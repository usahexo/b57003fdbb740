# What is Charlotte Hornets?

The Charlotte Hornets are a professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The team is part of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The name of the team is derived from the city's original NBA franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats. The franchise was established in 2004 as an expansion team.

The Hornets play their home games at Time Warner Cable Arena in Uptown Charlotte. The team has made three playoff appearances, reaching the second round twice.

The Hornets have a rich history that dates back to when they were first established as an expansion team in 2004. The team had moderate success in their early years, making it to the playoffs twice and even reaching the second round on two separate occasions. However, things started to take a turn for the worse in 2011 when the Bobcats went on a record-setting losing streak that lasted for over two years. This eventually led to them being rebranded as the Hornets in 2014.

Since then, the Hornets have been on a mission to redeem themselves and recapture some of their former glory. And while they haven't quite reached those heights yet, they've shown consistent progress and seem to be headed in the right direction. With a new owner, head coach, and roster of players, there's a lot of excitement surrounding this team and its fans are hopeful that they can finally bring an NBA championship home to Charlotte.

The community that would eventually become the town of Dumas began as a stop on the Panhandle and Santa Fe Railroad in 1881. In 1882, J.C. Wheat and sons built a store and post office called Wheatfield Station; it would later became Dumas after Missouri Senator Thomas T. (Tom) Major Dumas who helped get the railroad through the area. The first train stop was made on July 4, 1881, but because no agent was on duty at the time, no one knows for sure when the town actually got its name [1].

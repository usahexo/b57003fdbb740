#  Thailand Raises Minimum Gambling Age to 21

Thailand is the latest country to raise the minimum gambling age amid concerns over addiction and social ills. The new measure, which took effect on Jan. 1, raises the minimum age from 18 to 21.

"The government wants to protect people, especially the young, from being harmed by gambling," said a government spokesman.

Thailand is not the only country to take this step; both Japan and South Korea have also raised their minimum gambling ages in recent years. In Japan, the minimum age was raised from 18 to 20 in 2017, while in South Korea it was increased from 19 to 21 in 2012.

There are many reasons for raising the minimum gambling age. One is that young people are more vulnerable to developing addictions than adults. Another reason is that gambling can have negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole. Gambling can lead to financial problems, family conflict, and even crime.

Some people argue that raising the minimum age does not go far enough and that all gambling should be banned for people of all ages. However, others argue that adults should be allowed to make their own decisions about whether or not to gamble. They say that if someone is old enough to vote or serve in the military, they should be old enough to gamble legally.

What do you think? Should the minimum gambling age be raised? Is it right for adults to be able to gamble freely, or should there be restrictions in place? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below!

#  Thailand Government Announces Increase in Gambling Age

The Thai government has announced that it will increase the minimum gambling age from 18 to 21 as part of a new national strategy to combat problem gambling. The move, which was first proposed by the Thai National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) in November last year, is set to come into effect on 1st February 2019.

Thailand is one of only a handful of countries where the minimum legal gambling age is 18. In neighbouring Malaysia, the age limit is 21, while in Singapore it is 23. The United States has a minimum gambling age of 21, while in Australia it is 18.

In announcing the change, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam said that raising the minimum age would help protect young people from becoming addicted to gambling. “We have to think about the future and how we can protect our children from negative effects such as addictive behaviour and indebtedness,” he said.

According to a study by Mahidol University released last year, around 10% of Thais aged 15-19 are problem gamblers, with the figure rising to 16% among those in their early 20s. The study also showed that problem gamblers are more likely to experience mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, as well as financial difficulties.

In response to criticism that the new measure will push problem gamblers underground and make it more difficult for them to access help, Mr Krea-ngam said that the government would be stepping up its efforts to provide prevention and treatment services. “We are not just increasing the age limit but also preparing measures to deal with addiction problems including expanding centres nationwide and increasing manpower at these centres by three times,” he said.

Critics have also raised concerns that the change will have a negative impact on Thailand’s casino industry, which currently employs around 300,000 people. However, Mr Krea-ngam insisted that this would not be the case. “The government does not intent to close down casinos but wants them to be run responsibly under stricter rules,” he said.

#  Thailand Extends Gambling Age to Combat Addiction

Thailand has announced that it is extending the gambling age from 18 to 20 in an attempt to address a growing gambling addiction problem. The news was confirmed by Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam, who said that the change will come into effect later this year.

The extended gambling age is just one of a number of new measures being put in place by the Thai government in order to combat gambling addiction. The government is also investing in increasing public awareness of the dangers of gambling, and plans to provide more support services for those with addiction problems.

Gambling is a popular pastime in Thailand, and there are numerous legal and illegal casinos throughout the country. Gambling addiction is a serious problem, however, with an estimated 2 million Thais addicted to gambling. In addition to causing financial problems for those affected, gambling addiction can also lead to health problems and social isolation.

The government’s new measures are aimed at addressing these issues. In addition to the extended gambling age, officials plans to shut down unlicensed casinos and increase restrictions on advertising for casinos. They are also considering introducing a cap on the amount that people can bet each day.

It is hoped that these measures will help reduce Thailand’s gambling addiction rates and improve the lives of those affected by it.

#  Minimum Gambling Age in Thailand Increased to 21

On 1st December 2017, the Thai government announced that the minimum gambling age is being increased from 18 to 21. This is part of a crackdown on illegal gambling in the country.

The new gambling law came into effect on 1st January 2018. It covers all forms of gambling, including online gambling and sports betting. The minimum age for these activities has been increased from 18 to 21.

 violators of the new law could face a jail sentence of up to five years or a fine of up to 100,000 Baht (approximately US$3,000).

The government has said that the aim of the new law is to protect young people from the harms associated with gambling. These include addiction, financial problems, and social problems.

Opposition parties have criticised the government for increasing the minimum age, saying that it will force young people to gamble illegally. However, the government has defended the move, saying that it is necessary to protect young people from harm.

#  Thailand Increases Gambling Age to Combat Problem Gambling

In a move to combat the increasing problem of gambling addiction in Thailand, the government has voted to raise the minimum age for gambling from 18 to 21. The new law will go into effect on July 1st, 2018.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem in Thailand, with an estimated 2 million people addicted to gambling. This accounts for about 10 percent of the population. In addition to the health and social problems caused by gambling addiction, it also costs the Thai economy an estimated $6.4 billion per year.

The government has been trying to address the problem of gambling addiction for many years, but with limited success. The new law raising the minimum age for gambling is hoped to be more effective in combating the problem.

Under the new law, only people over 21 will be able to gamble in casinos, bet on horse racing, or play lottery games. People under 21 will still be able to gamble in online casinos and betting parlors, but these establishments will have to obtain a license from the government in order to operate.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for individuals and families. The new law raising the minimum age for gambling is a step in the right direction in combating this problem in Thailand.

#  Buffalo Run Casino Finally Answers the Question: Who Owns It?

After several months of speculation and rumor, the Buffalo Run Casino has finally released information about who owns the casino. The answer may come as a surprise to some.

According to documents filed with the Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association, the Buffalo Run Casino is owned by the Chickasaw Nation. This revelation comes as a bit of a surprise, as the Chickasaw Nation is based in Ada, Oklahoma, while the Buffalo Run Casino is located in Miami, Oklahoma.

The Chickasaw Nation has not commented on why it decided to purchase the Buffalo Run Casino, nor what its plans are for the casino. However, many people are speculating that the Chickasaw Nation will make some major changes to the casino in order to improve its profitability.

The Chickasaw Nation has a long history of involvement in the gambling industry. In addition to owning the Buffalo Run Casino, it also owns two other casinos: WinStar World Casino and Resort and Gold Strike Casino Resort. It also operates Choctaw Casinos & Resorts, which is the largest Native American-owned casino operator in North America.

The ownership of the Buffalo Run Casino is sure to stir up some controversy. The casino has been embroiled in a legal battle with Miami Mayor Tom Witt over its tax payments. Witt has argued that the casino should be paying more taxes given its $100 million annual revenue.

However, with the Chickasaw Nation now officially owning the casino, it is likely that this issue will be resolved soon. The Chickasaw Nation is known for being a powerful and influential tribe, and it is likely that it will not take kindly to being challenged by Mayor Witt or anyone else.

#  Get the most out of your Mornar play!

This guide will show you how to get the most out of your Mornar play!

The first step is to identify the key themes of the work. In Mornar, these are: betrayal, duty, and revenge. With these themes in mind, you can begin to look for specific examples in the text that illustrate them.

Betrayal is a major theme in Mornar. One of the best examples of this is when Mornar's brother, Kralj, betrays him by joining forces with their enemies. This betrayal costs Mornar dearly, as it leads to his imprisonment and eventual exile.

Another theme that is prevalent in Mornar is duty. This is seen most clearly when Mornar chooses to return to his home country and fight against his former brother Kralj. Even though it means facing certain death, Mornar persists because he feels it is his duty to do so.

Finally, revenge is a critical factor in the story of Mornar. After being betrayed and exiled by his own brother, Mornar spends many years planning his revenge. When the time finally comes, he executes his plan flawlessly and succeeds in taking down Kralj.

Once you have a good understanding of the key themes of the work, you can begin to look for specific quotes that support them. Here are some examples:

On betrayal: "My own brother... He has joined our enemies." (Mornar) 
"I am returning to my countrymen not as their friend but as their avenger." (Mornar)  “All these years I have dreamed of this moment – of taking my revenge upon Kralj.” (Mornar) 
"Revenge is a dish best served cold." (Moral of the story)

On duty: "I am returning to my countrymen not as their friend but as their avenger." (Mornar)  “It is my duty to do so.” (Mornar)

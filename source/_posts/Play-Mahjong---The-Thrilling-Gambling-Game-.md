#  How To Play Mahjong - The Essential Guide 

Mahjong (麻将, má jiàng) is a popular tile-based game that is believed to have originated in China over 2,000 years ago. The game is a complex mix of skill, strategy and luck, and can be enjoyed by players of all ages.

If you're new to Mahjong, or if you're looking for some tips on how to improve your gameplay, read on for the essential guide to playing Mahjong.

# The Mahjong Board 
The Mahjong board is made up of a grid of tiles, with each tile representing a different character or object. The aim of the game is to remove all of the tiles from the board by matching them together.

There are several different types of Mahjong board, but the most common type is a 4x4 board with 16 tiles in total. Other boards may have different numbers of tiles and different shapes, so it's important to be familiar with the layout of your board before starting the game.

# The Tiles 
There are three main types of Mahjong tiles: Honour Tiles, Character Tiles and Bonus Tiles. Honour Tiles are red and include the Chinese symbol for East (東), West (西), South (南) and North (北). Character Tiles are green and represent various objects such as flowers, animals and plants. There are also four Bonus Tiles which are typically depicted as gold coins.

Bonus Tiles do not belong to any particular set, and can be matched with any other tile. However, they cannot be used to form sequences or triplets like other tiles can.

# The Hand 
A Mahjong hand consists of 14 tiles arranged in four groups of three tiles known as "suits". There are three suits in Mahjong - dots (圓), bamboos (紙) and characters (人). Each suit contains two Honour Tiles and one Character Tile. The suits should be arranged in descending order according to their value, with 1 being the highest and 9 being the lowest. So your hand might look something like this:

      

The six dots represent the number 6 suit, while the two bamboos represent the number 2 suit. As there is no 3 suit in Mahjong, there is no 3rd Honour Tile in this hand. Finally, the character "人" represents the number 4 suit.

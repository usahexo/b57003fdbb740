#  Billions Of Dollars At Risk Due To Gambling Addiction

Problem gambling, also known as gambling addiction, is a progressive mental disorder that is characterized by compulsive participation in gambling activities despite harmful consequences. Problem gambling is the most serious type of gambling addiction and occurs when someone loses the ability to control their betting habits.

Problem gambling can have a serious impact on both the individual and their loved ones. The most common symptoms of problem gambling include losing large sums of money, chasing losses, lying about gambling, borrowing money from friends or family to gamble with, selling possessions to finance gambling and neglecting bills or chores in order to gamble.

Those affected by problem gambling are also at risk of depression, anxiety and suicide. In extreme cases, problem gamblers may resort to criminal activity in order to fund their addiction.

The cost of problem gambling to society is estimated to be over $5 billion annually in the United States alone. This figure includes costs related to crime, healthcare, bankruptcy and lost productivity. It is believed that the true cost of problem gambling is much higher as many problems caused by gambling are not reported.

Gambling addiction can be treated through a combination of therapies including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing and medication if necessary. For those affected by problem gambling, treatment is essential in order to protect themselves and their loved ones from the negative consequences of this disorder.

#  Gambling addiction rates increase as pala casino expands

Gambling addiction rates are on the rise across the United States, and experts say the expansion of casinos, including Pennsylvania’s new pala casino, is to blame.

A report released in February by the Gaming Commission found that one in five problem gamblers in Massachusetts resides in the Greater Boston area, home to pala casino and two other resorts. In 2013, the last year for which data was available, there were 5,500 problem gamblers in Massachusetts.

Nationwide, gambling addiction is becoming an increasingly big problem. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that between 6 and 8 million Americans are addicted to gambling.

# What is causing this increase in gambling addiction rates?

So what is causing this increase in gambling addiction rates? There are a number of factors at play.

For one, casinos are becoming more prevalent. In addition to traditional casinos, there are now Indian casinos, online casinos, and state-run lotteries. With so many options available, it’s easier than ever for people to develop a gambling habit.

Another factor is that gambling is increasingly being viewed as a socially acceptable form of entertainment. With so much advertising geared towards convincing people that gambling is a fun activity, it’s no wonder so many people are succumbing to its lure.

And finally, many people view gambling as a way to make easy money. They think that if they just put a little money on red at the roulette table or bet on their favorite team, they’ll be sure to come out ahead. But as anyone who has ever gambled knows, this is not always the case. In fact, most people who gamble lose money in the long run.

#  Texas Could Lose Millions if Gambling is Banned in Galveston

Gambling is a popular pastime in Texas, and lawmakers in Galveston are considering a bill that would ban gambling within the city limits. If passed, the bill could cost the city millions in lost revenue.

Texas is one of only a handful of states that doesn't have specific laws regulating gambling. This has led to a patchwork of rules and regulations that vary from city to city. In Galveston, gambling is currently legal in casinos, race tracks, and bingo parlors.

The proposed ban on gambling would apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and sports betting. It would also prohibit businesses from promoting or advertising gambling activities.

Supporters of the bill argue that gambling can lead to addiction and crime, and that it's not appropriate for a family-friendly resort town like Galveston. They say the ban would protect residents and visitors from the negative effects of gambling.

Opponents of the ban argue that it would be a blow to the local economy, and that it's not clear how it would be enforced. They also point out that Galveston already has laws prohibiting disorderly conduct and public intoxication, which should be enough to address any potential problems associated with gambling.

If passed, the ban on gambling would go into effect on January 1st, 2020.

#  Proposed Bill to Ban Gambling in Galveston met with Mixed Reactions

On Tuesday, the proposed bill to ban gambling in Galveston was met with mixed reactions from the people of the city. The proposed bill, which was announced by Mayor Jim Yarbrough, would make it illegal for any type of gambling activity to take place within city limits.

While some residents voiced their support for the bill, others argued that it would do more harm than good. One resident even went as far as to say that the ban would only push gambling activity underground and make it more difficult to track and regulate.

So far, there has been no official word on when or if the bill will be voted on by the city council. In the meantime, both supporters and opponents of the proposed ban will continue to make their voices heard.

#  More than Half of Galveston Supports Banning Gambling

According to a recent poll, more than half of Galveston County residents support banning gambling in the island city. The poll, which was commissioned by the anti-gambling group Citizens Against Gambling in Galveston (CAGG), found that 55 percent of those surveyed supported a ban on all forms of gambling in the city.

“This poll confirms what we’ve been hearing from our members for years,” said CAGG spokesperson Stephanie Neely. “Galveston residents don’t want gambling in their city and they are tired of its negative effects.”

The poll also found that 73 percent of respondents believe that gambling has had a negative impact on Galveston, while 71 percent said they believe it contributes to crime. In addition, more than two-thirds (68 percent) said they think gambling is harmful to the local economy.

Supporters of legalized gambling have argued that it can be a source of revenue for the city, but the poll shows that most Galveston residents don’t believe that is the case. Only 29 percent of respondents said they thought gambling generated significant revenue for Galveston, while 58 percent said it generated little or no revenue.

Neely praised the results of the poll and thanked everyone who participated. “We are grateful to the citizens of Galveston for standing with us against gambling,” she said. “We will continue working to make sure that Galveston remains a safe and healthy community free from this harmful industry.”

#  Gambling in Galveston Could be Outlawed as Early as Next Week

Gambling in Galveston could be outlawed as early as next week, if the city council votes in favor of the proposed ordinance.

The ordinance, which was first proposed by Mayor Jim Yarbrough, would prohibit all forms of gambling within the city limits, including charitable bingo and casino nights.

Yarbrough said that he proposed the ordinance after hearing complaints from residents about the negative effects of gambling.

“I’ve had a number of people come to me and say that they don’t like it when their neighbor is trying to beat them at bingo or when they have to listen to people screaming and carrying on at the casino night,” Yarbrough said.

Supporters of the ordinance argue that it would help reduce crime and promote responsible gambling behavior. However, opponents argue that it would lead to job losses and hurt the local economy.

The vote on the ordinance is scheduled for next Wednesday.

# Texas Could Lose Millions If Gambling is Banned in Galveston

A recent study by the University of Houston’s Hobby School of Public Affairs has found that if Texas bans gambling in Galveston, the state could lose millions of dollars in revenue.

The study, which was funded by the Casino Association of Texas, estimates that the state would lose $410 million in revenue if casino gambling is banned in Galveston. This would include revenue from taxes and jobs at the casinos.

Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has called for a ban on casino gambling in Galveston, saying that it is a “threat to families and children.” He has also cited concerns about crime and addiction as reasons for wanting to ban casino gambling in the city.

However, opponents of the ban say that it would cost the state jobs and revenue. They also argue that there is no evidence that casino gambling is harmful to families or communities.

The debate over casino gambling in Galveston is likely to continue, but one thing is clear: If Texas bans gambling in Galveston, it will lose millions of dollars in revenue.

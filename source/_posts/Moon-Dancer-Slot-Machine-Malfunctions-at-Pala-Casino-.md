#  Moon Dancer Slot Machine Malfunctions at Pala Casino 

Hundreds of people were left angry and frustrated after malfunctions with a newly installed Moon Dancer slot machine at the Pala Casino Resort and Spa in California. According to reports, the machines stopped working shortly after they were turned on and began spitting out coins uncontrollably.

In a video posted to social media, people can be seen pushing and shoving as they try to collect as many coins as possible. Some casino-goers said they managed to fill up buckets and bags with the loose change, while others were less fortunate.

"It was just complete pandemonium," said one eyewitness. "People were throwing punches and swearing up a storm. It was just a mess."


The casino has since issued an apology to guests who were affected by the malfunction, stating that it is working with the manufacturer to determine the cause of the issue. In the meantime, officials say that all other Moon Dancer machines have been turned off for safety reasons.

It was just another day at the casino for Nasser and Nancy Harb when they decided to try their luck on the Moon Dancer slot machine. The couple had no idea that their $10 bet would result in a $100,000 payout.

“We were just playing and having fun,” said Nancy. “When we won, we couldn’t believe it. We were so excited!”

The Harbs are the latest winners of a major jackpot at Pala Casino Resort Spa. In February, a San Diego man won nearly $1 million playing blackjack. Just last week, a Temecula woman hit a $560,000 jackpot on a Megabucks slot machine.

“These kinds of wins are becoming more common as our players become more skilled and seek out the best games and hottest machines,” said Gary Selkowitz, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Pala Casino Resort Spa.

Pala Casino Resort Spa is located in San Diego County and offers more than 2,000 slot machines and 120 table games.

#  Free Fountain Drinks No Longer Available at Pala Casino's Moon Dancer Game 

The Moon Dancer game at Pala Casino is one of the most popular slot machines on the casino floor. It's been a mainstay for years and offers players a variety of ways to win, including free drinks. But that's no longer the case.

According to a report from The San Diego Union-Tribune, Pala Casino has removed free fountain drinks from the Moon Dancer game. Players will now have to purchase beverages from the casino's bars and restaurants.

A spokesperson for the casino told the Union-Tribune that the change was made in order to "improve overall customer service." But many players aren't happy with the decision, saying that it makes an already difficult game even more frustrating.

"Pala's not the only casino with these games, but they're one of the last ones to still give out free drinks," one player told the Union-Tribune. "It's ridiculous."

The Moon Dancer game is one of several slot machines at Pala Casino that offer players the chance to win free beverages. But as of September 1st, those days are over. Players will now have to purchase any drinks they want while playing at the casino.

#  Pala Casino to Remove Moon Dancer Slot Machine

On Thursday, Pala Casino Spa and Resort announced they will be removing the Moon Dancer slot machine from their property. The casino's spokesperson said that the decision was made after several complaints from guests about the machine's "addictive gameplay."

"We want to ensure that our guests have a positive experience when they visit Pala Casino Spa and Resort," said the spokesperson in a statement. "And that includes being able to enjoy our games without feeling like they're being taken advantage of."

The Moon Dancer slot machine has been a fixture at Pala Casino for over five years, but it looks like its time is up. Guests who enjoy playing the game can still do so at other casinos in the area.

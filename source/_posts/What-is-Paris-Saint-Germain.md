#  How much money do they spend on players' wages?

The total amount of money being spent on players' wages around the world is increasing each year. In 2015, it was estimated that clubs in Europe's top five leagues spent a combined $5.3 billion on player salaries. That number is only going to continue to grow, as teams are becoming more and more willing to spend big money on the best talent around.

There are a few different ways to measure how much money is being spent on players' wages. One popular method is to look at the average salary of all players in a given league. Another way is to look at the amount of money being spent on the highest-paid players in a league. Regardless of which method is used, it is clear that spending on player salaries is rapidly increasing around the world.

In England's Premier League, for example, the average salary of all players in the league was over $4 million in 2017. The top 10 earners in the Premier League all make over $10 million per year, and the two highest-paid players in the league - Paul Pogba and Neymar - both earn over $30 million per year.

In Spain's La Liga, meanwhile, the average salary of all players was just under $3 million in 2017. The top 10 earners in La Liga make an average of just over $13 million per year, with Lionel Messi earning by far the most at over $37 million per year.

Italy's Serie A averaged out to just under $2.5 million per player in 2017, while France's Ligue 1 averaged just over $2 million per player. In Germany's Bundesliga, meanwhile, the average salary was just under $2 million per player in 2017. The top 10 earners in the Bundesliga make an average of just over $9 million per year, with Robert Lewandowski earning by far the most at over $17 million per year.

So what is causing this rapid increase in spending on player salaries? There are a few factors at play here. First, teams are getting bigger and richer thanks to new TV deals and other sources of revenue growth. Additionally, there has been a global increase in demand for top talent as soccer (or football) continues its ascent as one of the world's most popular sports. Lastly, technology has made it easier than ever for teams to scout and sign new players from around the world.

All of these factors have resulted in teams spending more and more money on acquiring and retaining talent. As this trend continues, we can expect to see even higher wages being paid to players around the world.

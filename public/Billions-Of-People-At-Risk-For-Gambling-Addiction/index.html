The disorder often carries a social stigma, causing those who struggle with it to feel ashamed and reluctant to seek help. But problem gambling is an addiction like any other, and it deserves to be treated as such.</p>
<p>An estimated 2 percent of the world’s population is affected by problem gambling. This amounts to nearly 470 million people, making it one of the most common addictions in the world. And yet, too often it is viewed as a harmless pastime.</p>
<p>The reality is quite different. Gambling can have a devastating impact on both the gambler’s life and their loved ones. It can lead to financial ruin, job loss, relationship problems, and even suicide.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why people develop a gambling addiction. Some may be drawn to the thrill of the game or the potential for big winnings. Others may use gambling as a way to cope with stress or emotional problems. Whatever the reason, problem gambling is a serious disorder that requires treatment.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. There are many rehab centres that specialize in treating this type of addiction. Don’t hesitate to seek help if you need it. You don’t have to fight this battle alone.</p>

Problem gambling is the most serious type of gambling addiction and occurs when someone loses the ability to control their betting habits.</p>
<p>Problem gambling can have a serious impact on both the individual and their loved ones. The most common symptoms of problem gambling include losing large sums of money, chasing losses, lying about gambling, borrowing money from friends or family to gamble with, selling possessions to finance gambling and neglecting bills or chores in order to gamble.</p>
<p>Those affected by problem gambling are also at risk of depression, anxiety and suicide. In extreme cases, problem gamblers may resort to criminal activity in order to fund their addiction.</p>
<p>The cost of problem gambling to society is estimated to be over $5 billion annually in the United States alone. This figure includes costs related to crime, healthcare, bankruptcy and lost productivity. It is believed that the true cost of problem gambling is much higher as many problems caused by gambling are not reported.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can be treated through a combination of therapies including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing and medication if necessary. For those affected by problem gambling, treatment is essential in order to protect themselves and their loved ones from the negative consequences of this disorder.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-risks-one-in-six-people"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-risks-one-in-six-people" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction risks one in six people"></a>Gambling addiction risks one in six people</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can affect people from all walks of life. It can ruin lives, marriages, and families. It is also potentially very costly, both financially and emotionally.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why people become addicted to gambling. Some may be trying to escape from their problems, while others may find the thrill of gambling addicting. Whatever the reason, it is important to understand the risks associated with gambling addiction before you decide to gamble.</p>
<p>According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, one in six people in the United States have a problem with gambling. This means that millions of people are at risk for developing an addiction to gambling.</p>
<p>The most common sign of a gambling addiction is when someone cannot control their gambling behavior. They may continue to gamble even after losing money or experience negative consequences as a result of their gambling.</p>
<p>People with a gambling addiction may also exhibit other signs and symptoms such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>feeling anxious or restless when they cannot gamble</li>
<li>lying about their gambling habits</li>
<li>being unable to resist the urge to gamble</li>
<li>feeling helpless and hopeless about their situation</li>
<li>withdrawing from friends and family members</li>
<li>experiencing financial problems due to gambling losses</li>
</ul>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to seek help right away. There are many resources available for people who want to get help, including counseling, support groups, and treatment programs.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-rates-increase-as-pala-casino-expands"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-rates-increase-as-pala-casino-expands" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction rates increase as pala casino expands"></a>Gambling addiction rates increase as pala casino expands</h1><p>Gambling addiction rates are on the rise across the United States, and experts say the expansion of casinos, including Pennsylvania’s new pala casino, is to blame.</p>
<p>A report released in February by the Gaming Commission found that one in five problem gamblers in Massachusetts resides in the Greater Boston area, home to pala casino and two other resorts. In 2013, the last year for which data was available, there were 5,500 problem gamblers in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Nationwide, gambling addiction is becoming an increasingly big problem. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that between 6 and 8 million Americans are addicted to gambling.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-causing-this-increase-in-gambling-addiction-rates"><a href="#What-is-causing-this-increase-in-gambling-addiction-rates" class="headerlink" title="What is causing this increase in gambling addiction rates?"></a>What is causing this increase in gambling addiction rates?</h1><p>So what is causing this increase in gambling addiction rates? There are a number of factors at play.</p>
<p>For one, casinos are becoming more prevalent. In addition to traditional casinos, there are now Indian casinos, online casinos, and state-run lotteries. With so many options available, it’s easier than ever for people to develop a gambling habit.</p>
<p>Another factor is that gambling is increasingly being viewed as a socially acceptable form of entertainment. With so much advertising geared towards convincing people that gambling is a fun activity, it’s no wonder so many people are succumbing to its lure.</p>
<p>And finally, many people view gambling as a way to make easy money. They think that if they just put a little money on red at the roulette table or bet on their favorite team, they’ll be sure to come out ahead. But as anyone who has ever gambled knows, this is not always the case. In fact, most people who gamble lose money in the long run.</p>

        <h1 id="What-is-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#What-is-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="What is Paris Saint-Germain?"></a>What is Paris Saint-Germain?</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi sɛ̃ ʒɛʁmɛ̃]), commonly known as Paris SG, Paris St-Germain or simply PSG, is a French professional football club based in the city of Paris. The club was formed in 1970 by the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain. PSG are the most successful club in French football history, having won 31 titles, including a record six Ligue 1 championships.</p>
<p>PSG have also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League on four occasions, reaching the final twice. The club has a huge following both domestically and internationally with over 34 million fans across social media platforms.</p>
<p>The Parc des Princes is the team’s home stadium and one of the largest stadiums in Europe, with a capacity of 48,749. PSG have several sister clubs around the world such as New York City FC in the United States, Al-Ahli Saudi FC in Saudi Arabia and São Paulo FC in Brazil.</p>
<h1 id="Origins"><a href="#Origins" class="headerlink" title="Origins"></a>Origins</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain were formed on 12 August 1970 following the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain. The combined club took the name of Paris Saint-Germain and adopted purple and white as their colours.[5] PSG played their first match on 27 August 1970 against Racing Club de France resulting in a 3–0 victory for PSG.[6]</p>
<p>In 1972, Pierre Gueguen became president of PSG and subsequently led the club to its first Coupe de France title in 1976. However, PSG were relegated from Division 1 two years later. Following Gueguen’s departure, Francis Borelli was appointed president and led the club back to Division 1 in 1983 before winning back-to-back Coupe de France titles in 1984 and 1985. In 1986, coached by Luis Fernandez, PSG reached their first European Cup semi-final where they narrowly lost out to Bayern Munich on away goals.</p>
<h1 id="Where-is-Paris-Saint-Germain-located"><a href="#Where-is-Paris-Saint-Germain-located" class="headerlink" title="Where is Paris Saint-Germain located?"></a>Where is Paris Saint-Germain located?</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain F.C. is a professional association football club based in Paris, France. The club was formed in 1970 by the merger of two Paris-based clubs, Stade Saint-Germain and Paris FC. The holy trinity of strikers – Pauleta, Valdo and Rai helped PSG clinch their first ever Ligue 1 title in 1994&#x2F;1995 season which was also a historical season as it witnessed the retirement of one the greatest player to have graced the game, Michel Platini.</p>
<p>Sitting at the heart of France’s capital city, Paris Saint-Germain can be found at Parc des Princes Stadium – just south of the River Seine on Avenues Jean Baptiste Pointe Du Lac and Georges Pompidou respectively.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-main-rivals-of-PSG"><a href="#Who-are-the-main-rivals-of-PSG" class="headerlink" title="Who are the main rivals of PSG?"></a>Who are the main rivals of PSG?</h1><p>Since its inception, PSG has had several notable rivalries with fellow Ligue 1 sides Olympique de Marseille and AS Monaco; while also developing a more recent rivalry with Liga MX’s Club América (Mexico City).</p>
<p>However, it is their games against Olympique Lyonnais that are considered as the biggest fixtures for both PSG and their fans. The two teams have met in 42 editions of French domestic cup competitions (with Lyon winning 24 times to PSG’s 18), making it the most contested trophy rivalry between any two French football clubs.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-owners-of-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#Who-are-the-owners-of-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="Who are the owners of Paris Saint-Germain?"></a>Who are the owners of Paris Saint-Germain?</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain is a professional association football club based in Paris, France. The club was formed on 12 August 1970 by the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain. The current owners are Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), a state-owned company of the Qatar government.</p>
<p>The takeover by QSI was announced on 25 May 2011. The deal, worth around €100 million, netting the club an immediate cash injection. Since then, the club has gone from strength to strength, both on and off the pitch. The huge investment from QSI has seen PSG become one of the biggest clubs in world football and they now compete regularly in the UEFA Champions League.</p>
<p>Qatar Sports Investments is a diversified sports company owned by the Qatar government. It is responsible for developing sport in Qatar and it has a wide range of interests, including owning Paris Saint-Germain F.C., AS Monaco FC and Al Jazeera Sport.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-club’s-major-successes"><a href="#What-are-the-club’s-major-successes" class="headerlink" title="What are the club’s major successes?"></a>What are the club’s major successes?</h1><p>.<br>The major successes of the club are as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>Winning the Premier League twice (2015 and 2017) </li>
<li>Winning the FA Cup four times (2011, 2013, 2016, 2017) </li>
<li>Winning the League Cup three times (2014, 2016, 2018) </li>
<li>Winners of the UEFA Europa League in 2016-17</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="How-much-money-do-they-spend-on-players’-wages"><a href="#How-much-money-do-they-spend-on-players’-wages" class="headerlink" title="How much money do they spend on players’ wages?"></a>How much money do they spend on players’ wages?</h1><p>The total amount of money being spent on players’ wages around the world is increasing each year. In 2015, it was estimated that clubs in Europe’s top five leagues spent a combined $5.3 billion on player salaries. That number is only going to continue to grow, as teams are becoming more and more willing to spend big money on the best talent around.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to measure how much money is being spent on players’ wages. One popular method is to look at the average salary of all players in a given league. Another way is to look at the amount of money being spent on the highest-paid players in a league. Regardless of which method is used, it is clear that spending on player salaries is rapidly increasing around the world.</p>
<p>In England’s Premier League, for example, the average salary of all players in the league was over $4 million in 2017. The top 10 earners in the Premier League all make over $10 million per year, and the two highest-paid players in the league - Paul Pogba and Neymar - both earn over $30 million per year.</p>
<p>In Spain’s La Liga, meanwhile, the average salary of all players was just under $3 million in 2017. The top 10 earners in La Liga make an average of just over $13 million per year, with Lionel Messi earning by far the most at over $37 million per year.</p>
<p>Italy’s Serie A averaged out to just under $2.5 million per player in 2017, while France’s Ligue 1 averaged just over $2 million per player. In Germany’s Bundesliga, meanwhile, the average salary was just under $2 million per player in 2017. The top 10 earners in the Bundesliga make an average of just over $9 million per year, with Robert Lewandowski earning by far the most at over $17 million per year.</p>
<p>So what is causing this rapid increase in spending on player salaries? There are a few factors at play here. First, teams are getting bigger and richer thanks to new TV deals and other sources of revenue growth. Additionally, there has been a global increase in demand for top talent as soccer (or football) continues its ascent as one of the world’s most popular sports. Lastly, technology has made it easier than ever for teams to scout and sign new players from around the world.</p>
<p>All of these factors have resulted in teams spending more and more money on acquiring and retaining talent. As this trend continues, we can expect to see even higher wages being paid to players around the world.</p>

        <h1 id="What-is-Zoom-Roulette"><a href="#What-is-Zoom-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="What is Zoom Roulette?"></a>What is Zoom Roulette?</h1><p>Zoom Roulette is a game that can be played on Zoom Casino, an online casino that offers a variety of games. The game is a variation of roulette and is played with a standard roulette wheel and 36 numbered pockets. There are 18 black pockets and 18 red pockets.</p>
<p>In Zoom Roulette, players can bet on any number on the table or they can bet on colors. Players can also bet on whether the next spin will result in a red or black number. Bets can be placed before the spin or after the spin.</p>
<p>The game starts with all players placing their bets. Once all the bets are placed, the dealer spins the wheel and players can watch the ball bounce around until it comes to rest in one of the numbered pockets. The dealer then announces the winner and pays out winning bets.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an exciting online casino game to play, give Zoom Roulette a try!</p>

The amount they win will depend on how many matching numbers there are and which symbol is used.</p>
<p>There are four different symbols in Zoom Roulette Megaways slots: clubs, hearts, spades and diamonds.

<h2 id="Playing-Zoom-Roulette"><a href="#Playing-Zoom-Roulette" class="headerlink" title="Playing Zoom Roulette"></a>Playing Zoom Roulette</h2><p>Zoom roulette is a relatively new variant of the classic casino game, roulette. It’s played on a standard roulette wheel, but with a few additional features that make the game more exciting.</p>
<p>The basic rules of roulette still apply – you bet on which numbered slot the ball will end up in after it’s spun around the wheel. The difference with zoom roulette is that you can also bet on whether the ball will land in a red or black slot, or whether it will be odd or even.</p>
<p>Another exciting addition to zoom roulette is the ‘zoom’ feature. This allows you to see what’s happening on the wheel in real time, so you can make your bets accordingly. You can also use the zoom feature to follow the progress of your bets, and see how close you are to winning!</p>
<p>So how do you play zoom roulette? Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Choose a table. There are typically several Zoom Roulette tables available, each with its own betting limits. Find one that best suits your budget and playing style.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Place your chips on the relevant betting area on the table layout. For instance, if you want to bet on a black number coming up, place your chips on the black betting area. Be sure to read the payout schedule first though – some bets have better odds than others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you’re ready, hit ‘Play’ and watch as the ball spins around the wheel. If your bet wins, your chips will be automatically paid out at the corresponding rate. Otherwise, just wait for the next spin!</p>

The team is part of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The name of the team is derived from the city’s original NBA franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats. The franchise was established in 2004 as an expansion team.</p>
<p>The Hornets play their home games at Time Warner Cable Arena in Uptown Charlotte. The team has made three playoff appearances, reaching the second round twice.</p>
<p>The Hornets have a rich history that dates back to when they were first established as an expansion team in 2004. The team had moderate success in their early years, making it to the playoffs twice and even reaching the second round on two separate occasions. However, things started to take a turn for the worse in 2011 when the Bobcats went on a record-setting losing streak that lasted for over two years. This eventually led to them being rebranded as the Hornets in 2014.</p>
<p>Since then, the Hornets have been on a mission to redeem themselves and recapture some of their former glory. And while they haven’t quite reached those heights yet, they’ve shown consistent progress and seem to be headed in the right direction. With a new owner, head coach, and roster of players, there’s a lot of excitement surrounding this team and its fans are hopeful that they can finally bring an NBA championship home to Charlotte.</p>

        <h1 id="What-are-the-10-essential-Seoul-restaurants"><a href="#What-are-the-10-essential-Seoul-restaurants" class="headerlink" title="What are the 10 essential Seoul restaurants?"></a>What are the 10 essential Seoul restaurants?</h1><p>When it comes to finding the best food in Seoul, there are endless options to choose from. However, if you’re looking for restaurants that represent the heart and soul of this city, then you can’t go wrong with these 10 establishments.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Gaon 가온</li>

If you want to try these classic dishes for yourself, then make sure to head over to either Mapo Tofu or Gopdari Dakgalbi 주등갈비 restaurants. Both places serve up excellent versions of these staples dishes!</p>
<h1 id="What-do-they-serve"><a href="#What-do-they-serve" class="headerlink" title="What do they serve?"></a>What do they serve?</h1><p>Restaurants and cafes vary greatly in the items they serve. From burgers and fries to more exotic fare, it can be hard to know what to expect when you walk into a new place. Of course, some restaurants are better known for specific items than others, but there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question.</p>
<p>Many restaurants have menus that change daily or weekly, so it’s always best to ask what’s being served before making a decision. That said, here are a few of the most common items that you might find on a restaurant menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burgers and fries * Salads * Pizza * Sandwiches * Asian cuisine * Mexican food</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="What-is-the-price-range"><a href="#What-is-the-price-range" class="headerlink" title="What is the price range?"></a>What is the price range?</h1><p>The price range is the cost of a good or service. Goods can have different prices, and services can also have different prices. The price range is important because it lets people know how much something costs.</p>
<h1 id="What-affects-the-price"><a href="#What-affects-the-price" class="headerlink" title="What affects the price?"></a>What affects the price?</h1><p>There are different things that affect the price of a good or a service. The most important thing that affects the price is how much it costs to make the good or provide the service. Another thing that affects the price is how much people are willing to pay for it. Sometimes, lawmakers will set a minimum or maximum price for a good or a service. This helps to make sure that everyone can afford the good or service, and that businesses are not charging too much for it.</p>
<h1 id="How-popular-are-they"><a href="#How-popular-are-they" class="headerlink" title="How popular are they?"></a>How popular are they?</h1><p>According to a study conducted by YouGov, a global public opinion and data company, nearly half of all Americans (47%) have never heard of the blockchain technology. Furthermore, only 8% of people say they understand it “very well”. This suggests that the vast majority of people don’t know what it is or how it works.</p>
<p>Despite this lack of understanding, the number of people who have heard about blockchain technology has increased from 34% in 2017 to 41% in 2018. And, of those who have heard about it, a significant majority (73%) believe that it will have a positive impact on the world.</p>
<p>So, why is there such a disconnect between perception and understanding? And why do so many people believe in its potential? Let’s take a closer look.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Blockchain-Technology"><a href="#What-is-Blockchain-Technology" class="headerlink" title="What is Blockchain Technology?"></a>What is Blockchain Technology?</h2><p>At its core, blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent and tamper-proof transactions. It was first developed as part of the digital currency Bitcoin and is now being used in a variety of different industries.</p>
<p>One of the key benefits of blockchain is that it allows for trustless transactions. This means that there is no need for a third party to verify or approve transactions – they are carried out automatically through the use of cryptography. As a result, this could potentially revolutionize the way we do business and interact with each other online.</p>
<h2 id="The-Benefits-of-Blockchain-Technology"><a href="#The-Benefits-of-Blockchain-Technology" class="headerlink" title="The Benefits of Blockchain Technology"></a>The Benefits of Blockchain Technology</h2><p>There are many potential benefits of blockchain technology, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Increased security and fraud prevention – Transactions on the blockchain are secure and cannot be tampered with. As such, it could be used to prevent fraudulent activities such as identity theft and money laundering.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reduced transaction costs – There are no fees associated with using blockchain technology. This could potentially save businesses billions of dollars each year.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Increased transparency and accountability – All transactions on the blockchain are publicly available, meaning that they can be easily traced back to their origin. This could help to increase transparency and accountability in government and business institutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Why-are-they-essential"><a href="#Why-are-they-essential" class="headerlink" title="Why are they essential?"></a>Why are they essential?</h1><p>Essential oils have been used for centuries for their medicinal and therapeutic benefits. In recent years, they’ve gained in popularity as people have become more interested in natural remedies and alternative therapies. But what are essential oils, and what do they do?</p>
<p>Essential oils are exactly what they sound like – the essential oils of plants. These oils are extracted from the plants’ leaves, flowers, bark, stems, or roots, and they contain the plant’s unique medicinal and therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>There are dozens of different essential oils, each with its own unique properties and benefits. Some of the most popular essential oils include lavender oil, which is known for its relaxing and sedative effects; peppermint oil, which is great for alleviating headaches and nausea; and eucalyptus oil, which is a great natural disinfectant.</p>
<p>What makes essential oils so beneficial is that they contain powerful antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. They can help reduce inflammation in the body, fight infection, improve circulation, and promote healing. They can also be helpful in treating a variety of health conditions, including depression, anxiety, insomnia, respiratory issues, and digestive problems.</p>
<p>Essential oils can be used in a variety of ways – topically, inhaled, or ingested. Some people simply apply them directly to their skin; others use them in massage oil or lotion. Others diffuse them into the air using an essential oil diffuser; this is a great way to enjoy their therapeutic benefits while also cleansing the air. And finally, some people take essential oils internally by adding them to water or other drinks.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an all-natural way to improve your health and well-being, consider giving essential oils a try. They may just be what you’re looking for!</p>

However, there are a few ways to get the information you need.</p>
<p>One way is to ask the restaurant directly. Many restaurants have this information readily available, and they will be happy to provide it to you.</p>
<p>Another way is to use an app or website that collects nutritional information from restaurants. There are several of these apps and websites available, so you can choose the one that works best for you.</p>
<p>Finally, you can check the USDA database. This database contains nutrition information for tens of thousands of foods, including restaurant foods. However, the information may not be 100% accurate, so it’s always a good idea to check with the restaurant itself if possible.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-healthier-menu-options-when-eating-out"><a href="#What-are-some-healthier-menu-options-when-eating-out" class="headerlink" title="What are some healthier menu options when eating out?"></a>What are some healthier menu options when eating out?</h1><p>If you’re looking to make some healthier choices the next time you eat out, here are a few great options to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>At a Thai restaurant, try ordering a stir-fry with lots of vegetables and a lean protein like shrimp or chicken. </li>
<li>If Italian is more your style, go for a tomato-based pasta dish with lots of veggies. </li>
<li>For American cuisine, grilled chicken or fish are always good choices, as are salads with lean protein toppings. </li>
<li>At a Japanese restaurant, miso soup and Edamame are great appetizers, and salmon or chicken teriyaki make for healthy main courses. </li>
<li>Indian food is always flavorful and healthy, so opt for dishes like tandoori chicken or paneer masala. </li>
<li>Healthy eating doesn’t have to be expensive - many fast food joints now offer salads and wraps with lean protein options.</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter where you choose to eat, remember to ask your server about the healthiest options on the menu. And if there’s nothing that catches your eye, don’t be afraid to order something that can easily be modified to be healthier - for example, asking for your salad without dressing or cheese, or ordering grilled instead of fried chicken. With a little bit of effort, you can make healthy eating easy and delicious no matter where you are!</p>
<h1 id="How-can-you-make-smarter-choices-when-ordering-food"><a href="#How-can-you-make-smarter-choices-when-ordering-food" class="headerlink" title="How can you make smarter choices when ordering food?"></a>How can you make smarter choices when ordering food?</h1><p>There are a few things to keep in mind when ordering food - whether you’re at a restaurant or getting something delivered. Here are some tips:</p>
<p>-Think about what you’re eating. If you’re looking for something healthy, choose items that fit that criteria. If you’re not as concerned, there are still plenty of options that will be tasty and satisfying.</p>
<p>-Look at the menu before you order. This will help you to make a decision more quickly, and avoid having to wait for your waiter or delivery person to come back to your table.</p>
<p>-Avoid high-calorie dishes. Even if they sound delicious, foods like fried chicken or pasta dishes can quickly add up in terms of calories. Stick with lighter options whenever possible.</p>
<p>-Get what you need. If you’re ordering food for one, don’t get a large pizza or a dozen tacos - chances are, you’ll end up wasting food.Order smaller portions instead, so you can enjoy everything without overeating.</p>
<p>-Skip the drinks. Beverages can be surprisingly caloric, especially if they’re high in sugar or alcohol. Stick with water or unsweetened tea instead - it’s healthier and cheaper too!</p>
<h1 id="What-are-some-tips-for-avoiding-overeating-when-dining-out"><a href="#What-are-some-tips-for-avoiding-overeating-when-dining-out" class="headerlink" title="What are some tips for avoiding overeating when dining out?"></a>What are some tips for avoiding overeating when dining out?</h1><p>One thing to keep in mind when eating out is portion size. It can be easy to overeat when you’re not controlling the portion size yourself. Ask your server to bring a half or split plate instead of a full plate, which will help you control your portions. </p>
<p>Another tip is to choose lower-calorie options. Salads and broth-based soups are some great options, as are lean protein choices like grilled chicken or fish. And remember to avoid creamy sauces and toppings, which can add a lot of calories very quickly. </p>
<p>Lastly, try to avoid eating late at night. Eating a large meal right before bed can lead to weight gain over time, as your body isn’t able to burn off the calories as effectively. Instead, try snacking on healthy options like fruit or yogurt in the evening. </p>
<p>Following these tips can help you make healthier choices when dining out and prevent overeating.</p>

You can start by looking for menus online before you go to the restaurant. That way, you’ll have an idea of what’s available. You can also ask the server for recommendations, and see if they have any healthy options that fit your dietary needs. If all else fails, you can always order a salad or vegetable dish.</p>

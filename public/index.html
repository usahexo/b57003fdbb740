        <h1 id="What-percentage-of-poker-hands-go-to-a-flop"><a href="#What-percentage-of-poker-hands-go-to-a-flop" class="headerlink" title="What percentage of poker hands go to a flop?"></a>What percentage of poker hands go to a flop?</h1><p>There are many factors to consider when trying to answer this question.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to know is what type of poker game you’re playing. There are different variations of poker, and the percentage of hands that go to a flop will vary depending on the variant.</p>
<p>Next, you need to determine the number of players in the hand. Again, this will affect the percentage of flops since there are more potential players in some games than others.</p>
<p>Once you’ve determined those two factors, you can start looking at the odds for different hands. The odds will give you a general idea of how likely it is for a particular hand to reach the flop.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that these odds are just estimates; ultimately, the percentage of hands that go to a flop will vary from game to game and hand to hand. But this information can give you a good starting point when trying to determine whether or not to call a bet.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-odds-What-percentage-of-hands-go-to-a-flop"><a href="#Poker-odds-What-percentage-of-hands-go-to-a-flop" class="headerlink" title="Poker odds: What percentage of hands go to a flop?"></a>Poker odds: What percentage of hands go to a flop?</h1><p>When you play poker, unless you are playing in a particularly strange game, you will be dealt two cards down and five up. From these seven cards, you must make the best five-card hand possible. How often do your two hole cards make a good hand without any help from the flop?</p>
<p>This question can be broken down into a few different pieces. The first is what percentage of hands result in no pair on the board. This is called the “flop rate”. The second piece is what percentage of hands result in a pair on the board. This is called the “pairing rate”. Finally, we need to know what percentage of hands result in two pairs or better on the board. This is called the “royalty rate”.</p>
<p>To calculate the flop rate, we first need to know how many possible combinations of two cards there are. This turns out to be 252 (43 factorial). We then divide this number by the total number of combinations, which is 10, scientific notation (10^7 &#x3D; 1000000). So, the flop rate is 2.52%.</p>
<p>To calculate the pairing rate, we first need to know how many possible combinations of two cards there are that make a pair. This turns out to be 12 (2^6 &#x3D; 64). We then divide this number by the total number of combinations, which is 10, scientific notation (10^7 &#x3D; 1000000). So, the pairing rate is 0.12%.</p>
<p>To calculate the royalty rate, we first need to know how many possible combinations of two cards there are that make two pairs or better. This turns out to be six (2^3 &#x3D; 8). We then divide this number by the total number of combinations, which is 10, scientific notation (10^7 &#x3D; 1000000). So, the royalty rate is 0.06%.</p>
<h1 id="What’s-the-likelihood-of-hitting-a-flop-in-poker"><a href="#What’s-the-likelihood-of-hitting-a-flop-in-poker" class="headerlink" title="What’s the likelihood of hitting a flop in poker?"></a>What’s the likelihood of hitting a flop in poker?</h1><p>A poker player’s chances of flopping a hand can be estimated by counting the number of possible combinations that would result in that particular hand. For example, as there are only two cards of each rank in a deck, the likelihood of flopping a three-of-a-kind is 1&#x2F;220 (0.45%).</p>
<p>But what about when you’re playing Texas Hold’em with five community cards? To approximate the probability of hitting your desired hand on the flop, you need to calculate the number of possible card combinations for each stage of the game.</p>
<p> Before the flop, there are 2x2x3 &#x3D; 12 possible two-card combinations. After the flop, there are 47 (5x5x7) two-card combinations, since two cards have been put into play. And finally, on the turn and river there are 47 more (5x5x7) card combinations, for a total of 94. So, the odds of flopping your desired hold ‘em hand are approximately 4.6%.</p>
<h1 id="The-odds-of-flopping-a-hand-in-poker"><a href="#The-odds-of-flopping-a-hand-in-poker" class="headerlink" title="The odds of flopping a hand in poker"></a>The odds of flopping a hand in poker</h1><p>There are various factors that come into play when determining the odds of flopping a hand in poker. In this article, we will take a look at some of the key elements involved.</p>
<p>The first factor to consider is the number of possible hands that can be made. There are a total of 2,598,960 possible four-card combinations in Texas Hold’em (not including wild cards). This means that the odds of flopping any given hand are 1 in 2,598,960.</p>
<p>The second factor to consider is the number of hole cards remaining in the deck. The chances of flopping a particular hand decrease as the number of hole cards remaining decreases. For example, there are only four possible hands that can be made with two hole cards (one pair), so the odds of flopping one of these hands are 1 in 4. Conversely, there are six possible hands that can be made with three hole cards (two pairs or three of a kind), so the odds of flopping one of these hands are 1 in 6. As you can see, the fewer hole cards remaining, the less likely it is to flop a particular hand.</p>
<p>The third factor to consider is your position at the table. Your position relative to the dealer affects your odds because it determines how many players remain to act after you. The further down the order you are, the more players remain and therefore the lower your chances of hitting your desired card combination become.</p>
<p>Finally, you also need to take into account your opponent’s position at the table. If they are on the button (i.e., last to act), their chances of hitting their desired card combination are reduced because they have less information about what others may be holding. Conversely, if they are in early position (e.g., first or second to act), their chances increase as they have more information about what other players may be holding.</p>
<p>So all these factors need to be taken into consideration when trying to work out your chances of flopping a particular hand in poker. But in general, your odds will usually range from around 1 in 20 (if you are on the button and there are few hole cards remaining) up to around 1 in 3 (if you are in early position and there are plenty of hole cards remaining).</p>
<h1 id="Poker-hands-that-go-to-a-flop"><a href="#Poker-hands-that-go-to-a-flop" class="headerlink" title="Poker hands that go to a flop"></a>Poker hands that go to a flop</h1><p>In poker, the flop is the first three community cards that are turned face up on the table at once. This can lead to some interesting hands that go to the river.</p>
<p>Here are some of the most common hands that go to a flop:</p>
<p>#1. Two Pair</p>
<p>Two pair is a hand that consists of two cards of the same rank and two other cards of different ranks, all of which are paired together. For example, if you are dealt two queens and two fours, you have two pair.</p>
<p>If you are playing against someone who has two pair, there is a good chance that the pot will be split between the two players. However, if one of your opponents has three of a kind or a full house, then they will likely beat your two pair hand.</p>
<p>#2. Three of a Kind</p>
<p>Three of a kind is a hand that consists of three cards of the same rank and any other card. If you are playing against someone who has three of a kind, then you will likely lose the hand. However, if you have four cards of the same rank, then you have four of a kind and will likely win the pot.</p>
<p>#3. Straight</p>
<p>A straight is a hand that consists of five consecutive cards of any suit. If you are playing against someone who has a straight, then you will likely lose the hand. However, if you have six consecutive cards (a straight flush), then you will likely win the pot.</p>

        <h1 id="Couple-Plays-Baccarat-Together-In-Vegas"><a href="#Couple-Plays-Baccarat-Together-In-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Couple Plays Baccarat Together In Vegas"></a>Couple Plays Baccarat Together In Vegas</h1><p>Las Vegas is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. People from all walks of life visit the city to try their luck at the casinos. For some, it’s a chance to win big and change their lives. For others, it’s simply a way to have some fun and spend time with friends or family.</p>
<p>No matter what your reason for visiting Las Vegas may be, there’s one thing that everyone can enjoy: baccarat. This thrilling game has been around for centuries and continues to be one of the most popular casino games today. If you’re looking for a new way to experience Las Vegas, why not try playing baccarat together with your partner?</p>
<p>Baccarat is a simple game to learn but can be surprisingly engaging and exciting. In fact, many people find it to be more thrilling than blackjack or poker. There are three possible outcomes in baccarat: player win, banker win, and tie. The aim of the game is to get as close as possible to nine points without going over.</p>
<p>If you’re playing baccarat together as a couple, there are a few things you’ll need to keep in mind. First, make sure you agree on how much money you’re each willing to risk. It’s also important to be aware of each other’s betting tendencies; if one of you tends to bet aggressively while the other is more conservative, you’ll need to compromise in order to avoid any arguments during play.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that baccarat is a game of chance so don’t get too upset if things don’t go your way. The key is to have fun and enjoy the experience together!</p>
<h1 id="Couple-Falls-In-Love-Playing-Baccarat-In-Vegas"><a href="#Couple-Falls-In-Love-Playing-Baccarat-In-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Couple Falls In Love Playing Baccarat In Vegas"></a>Couple Falls In Love Playing Baccarat In Vegas</h1><p>A couple falls in love while playing baccarat at the Venetian in Las Vegas. They had both been married previously and were now both in their 50s.</p>
<p>The woman was from Texas and the man was from California. They had both been in Las Vegas for a business conference and had decided to play baccarat one night at the casino.</p>
<p>They started talking and realized that they both had grown up on ranches in Texas and California. They also found out that they both loved horses and had ridden them since they were kids.</p>
<p>They kept talking and before they knew it, they were exchanging stories about their past marriages and how they had ended. They also talked about their current lives and what they were looking for in a relationship.</p>
<p>The woman told the man that she had been divorced for 5 years and that she was tired of being alone. The man told the woman that he had been divorced for 10 years and that he was also tired of being alone.</p>
<p>By the end of the night, they had both fallen in love with each other. They exchanged numbers and agreed to meet for dinner the next night at the Bellagio Hotel across town.</p>
<p>They met for dinner and continued to talk for hours about their lives and their families. They also talked about things they wanted to do together, including riding horses on ranches in Texas and California.</p>
<p>They agreed to get married and have since moved back to Texas where they are now living on a ranch outside of Austin.</p>

But not for this lucky Las Vegas couple who hit the jackpot playing Baccarat in Sin City over the weekend.</p>
<p>The unidentified winners walked away with more than $1 million, according to casino officials. It was an unforgettable moment for them, and the whole experience was captured on video.</p>
<p>Baccarat is often seen as a high-roller game, so it’s not surprising that this couple won such a large amount of money. In fact, Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and it offers some pretty good odds for players.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to try your luck at Baccarat, there are a few things you should keep in mind. For starters, you need to understand the basic rules of the game. This isn’t too difficult, but it will give you a better chance of winning.</p>
<p>You should also familiarize yourself with the different betting options available to you. There are a variety of betting options available in Baccarat, so it’s important to pick the right ones if you want to increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Finally, you need to practice! Like any other skill, gambling can be improved by practicing regularly. The more you play Baccarat, the better you will become at making smart bets and winning big payouts.</p>
<h1 id="Couple-Becomes-One-Of-The-Best-Baccarat-Players-In-The-World"><a href="#Couple-Becomes-One-Of-The-Best-Baccarat-Players-In-The-World" class="headerlink" title="Couple Becomes One Of The Best Baccarat Players In The World"></a>Couple Becomes One Of The Best Baccarat Players In The World</h1><p>They had always been good at games of chance. When they were young, they would each take a turn picking a number between one and ten, and then whichever number was picked, that’s how many pieces of candy they would get. So even when they started playing baccarat as adults, their luck held true.</p>
<p>The husband was an engineer and the wife was a stay-at-home mom. They had three kids who were now all in college or out of the house. They had the time and money to travel and explore new hobbies. So when they found themselves in Monaco, one of the biggest gambling hubs in the world, they decided to try their hand at baccarat.</p>
<p>They quickly learned the basics of the game and started betting low-risk amounts. But as they kept playing, their bets got bigger and bigger. Eventually they were making hundreds of thousands of dollars in bets per game. Their winning streak continued for months, and before long they were considered some of the best players in the world.</p>
<p>Their success didn’t come without challenges, however. The other players at the casino quickly began to take notice of them, and some even started trying to sabotage their games by spreading rumors or trying to make them angry. But the couple stayed focused on their goal and eventually became the biggest winners in the casino.</p>
<p>Now when people think of Monaco, they think not only of its beautiful beaches and luxurious lifestyle, but also of the couple who made a small fortune playing baccarat there. And although they’ve since retired from gambling, their story still remains one of the most interesting (and unlikely) success stories in casino history.</p>
<h1 id="Couple-Retires-After-Winning-Big-Playing-Baccarat-In-Vegas"><a href="#Couple-Retires-After-Winning-Big-Playing-Baccarat-In-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Couple Retires After Winning Big Playing Baccarat In Vegas"></a>Couple Retires After Winning Big Playing Baccarat In Vegas</h1><p>A Las Vegas casino is ringing in the new year with a bit of good news. An unnamed couple has retired after winning big playing Baccarat at the casino.</p>
<p>Sources say the unnamed couple started playing Baccarat on New Year’s Day and didn’t stop until they hit the jackpot. It’s unclear exactly how much they won, but insiders say it was enough to give them a comfortable retirement.</p>
<p>The casino is still trying to figure out who the lucky winners are, but they say they’re very happy for them. In fact, one executive called it “the best New Year’s present we could ask for.”</p>
<p>Baccarat is a casino game that usually involves betting on cards. The goal is to get as close to 9 as possible, and whoever gets closest wins.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time someone has won big playing Baccarat in Vegas. Back in 2013, an Australian man won more than $10 million playing the game.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a way to retire early, maybe Baccarat is the game for you!</p>

Find the Best Blackjack Tables"></a>Don’t Risk It, Oklahoma! Find the Best Blackjack Tables</h1><p>Talk about blackjack in Oklahoma casinos and whether or not it’s worth your time.</p>
<p>There are plenty of blackjack tables throughout the Sooner State, but some casinos offer better games than others. Here are a few tips on where to find the best blackjack action in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The biggest casino in Oklahoma is WinStar World Casino and Resort, located just north of the Texas border. This large resort offers more than 100 blackjack tables, as well as other popular casino games like slots, video poker, and craps. The blackjack games at WinStar range from tight seven-deck games with low betting limits to loose double-deck games perfect for high rollers.</p>
<p>Just south of Tulsa is the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino. This Hollywood-themed casino is home to 50 blackjack tables, including a number of variations like Spanish 21 and Blackjack Switch. The minimum bet at Hard Rock is just $5, making it a great option for players on a budget.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a smaller casino with better games, try the Cherokee Casino in Tahlequah. This small casino has just 12 blackjack tables, but the games are notoriously loose. The minimum bet here is only $1, making it one of the best bets in Oklahoma.</p>
<h1 id="Head-to-a-Casino-and-Play-Blackjack-for-Fun-and-Profit-in-Oklahoma"><a href="#Head-to-a-Casino-and-Play-Blackjack-for-Fun-and-Profit-in-Oklahoma" class="headerlink" title="Head to a Casino and Play Blackjack for Fun and Profit in Oklahoma"></a>Head to a Casino and Play Blackjack for Fun and Profit in Oklahoma</h1><p>If you’re looking for a fun and exciting way to gamble, head to a casino and play blackjack. Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games, and it’s easy to learn how to play. You can also make some money while you’re at it!</p>
<p>The basic premise of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player is dealt two cards, and the dealer has two cards, one face up and one face down. The player can choose to take another card (hit) or stand. The goal is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21.</p>
<p>Some basic tips for playing blackjack include: </p>
<p>-Never hit on 16 or less.<br>-Always stand on 17 or higher.<br>-If you have an Ace and a 10, you have a blackjack and should always take another card.<br>-If the dealer has an Ace as their upcard, they will likely ask if you want insurance. This is a bad bet, so say no thanks!</p>
<p>There are also a few advanced strategies that can help you increase your chances of winning: </p>
<p>-Double down if you have a good hand (11 or higher). This means that you double your bet and receive just one more card.<br>-Split pairs if you have two cards of the same value (e.g., two 8s). This allows you to play each card as if it were a separate hand, with its own set of rules.<br>-Surrender if the odds are not in your favour. This means that you give up half your bet and end the hand early.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Win-at-Blackjack-in-Oklahoma-Casinos"><a href="#How-to-Win-at-Blackjack-in-Oklahoma-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="How to Win at Blackjack in Oklahoma Casinos"></a>How to Win at Blackjack in Oklahoma Casinos</h1><p>Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and it’s no different in Oklahoma. Whether you’re visiting a tribal casino or a commercial casino, the chances are good that you’ll find blackjack tables. So, what’s the best way to win at blackjack in Oklahoma casinos?</p>
<p>There is no single answer to that question, as blackjack is a complex game with many possible strategies. However, there are some basic tips that can help you improve your odds of winning. Firstly, try to avoid chasing losses. If you lose a few hands in a row, don’t be tempted to keep doubling down or splitting pairs in order to try and win back your money. Secondly, always make sure that you understand the rules of the game before playing. Thirdly, use basic strategy charts as a guide when making decisions during play. Finally, practice at home so that you can become comfortable with the game before playing for real money.</p>
<p>If you can follow these basic tips, you’ll be well on your way to winning at blackjack in Oklahoma casinos.</p>
<h1 id="Tips-for-Playing-Blackjack-in-Oklahoma"><a href="#Tips-for-Playing-Blackjack-in-Oklahoma" class="headerlink" title="Tips for Playing Blackjack in Oklahoma"></a>Tips for Playing Blackjack in Oklahoma</h1><p>Are you looking to play blackjack in Oklahoma? If so, you’re in luck – there are plenty of casinos where you can enjoy this classic card game. Blackjack is a simple game to learn but can be complex to play well. Here are some tips to help you improve your blackjack skills and hopefully increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>First and foremost, remember that the goal of the game is to beat the dealer. This means getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. Another important rule to remember is that blackjack always beats a hand of 21 points, no matter what the dealer has.</p>
<p>When it comes to playing your cards, always remember that Ace equals 1 or 11, whichever is better for your hand. The value of other cards depends on their number: 2 through 10 are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points.</p>
<p>If you have two cards of the same value (e.g. two 8s), you can split them into two separate hands. This will double your bet but also give you two chances to beat the dealer. If you split aces, however, you will only receive one additional card for each ace – and if you then go over 21 points, both hands are automatically considered busts.</p>
<p>If the dealer has an Ace showing and he hits another card, he will automatically have a “soft” 17 – which means he can still hit again without going over 21 points (although he might want to think twice about doing so if he already has a lot of points). On the other hand, if the dealer has a 7 or lower showing, he must hit on any further cards until he reaches at least 17 points total.</p>
<p>So how do you win at blackjack? Basic strategy says that you should always stand (not take any more cards) if your hand totals 17 or more points; otherwise, keep hitting until either you reach 21 or go bust (i.e. exceed 21 points). There are also other Tips For Playing Blackjack In Oklahoma which might come in handy depending on the particular casino and version of the game being played. For example, many casinos allow players to double down on any two cards – so if you have a strong starting hand, it may be wise to take advantage of this option.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that blackjack is a game of chance – no matter how skilled you may become at playing it! So always gamble responsibly and be mindful of your bankroll while playing this or any other casino game.</p>

<p>Industry analysts estimate that the global gaming market will suffer a loss of $120 billion in 2018, largely due to the waning popularity of console games.</p>
<p>At the root of the problem is the fact that gamers are increasingly turning to mobile apps and online games for their entertainment needs. In particular, new mobile games like Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds have been drawing in large numbers of players, while traditional console games like Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto are seeing declining sales.</p>
<p>This trend is likely to continue in the years ahead, as more gamers shift away from consoles and towards mobile devices. This could result in more than $200 billion in losses for the global gaming industry by 2020.</p>
<p>Despite these troubling trends, there are some companies that are managing to thrive in the current climate. For instance, Nintendo has seen strong sales of its Switch console, thanks in part to its popular games like Super Mario Odyssey and Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>Similarly, Epic Games has enjoyed huge success with Fortnite, which has now been downloaded over 100 million times on various platforms.</p>
<p>In light of these developments, it will be interesting to see how the gaming industry adapts over the next few years. Some companies may find success by focusing on mobile apps and online games, while others may struggle to keep up with changing consumer preferences.</p>
<h1 id="Gamblers-losing-more-money-than-ever-before"><a href="#Gamblers-losing-more-money-than-ever-before" class="headerlink" title="Gamblers losing more money than ever before"></a>Gamblers losing more money than ever before</h1><p>In the United States, gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry. Despite this, casinos are seeing an alarming trend of gamblers losing more money than ever before. The blame for this likely lies with the advent of online gambling, which has made it easier than ever for people to gamble from the comfort of their homes.</p>
<p>Casinos have responded to this trend by offering more and more gaming options, in the hope of appealing to a wider range of players. However, this seems to be having little effect, as losses continue to mount. In fact, some casinos are reporting that the average gambler is losing upwards of $1,000 per visit.</p>
<p>This situation is particularly troubling for casino operators, as they rely heavily on profits from gambling to cover their costs. With gamblers losing more money than ever before, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for casinos to turn a profit. This could lead to closures and job losses in an industry that already employs hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
<p>So why are gamblers losing so much money? There’s no one definitive answer to that question, but there are a few possible explanations. First and foremost, online gambling makes it easy for people to bet on sports and play casino games without leaving their homes. This can lead to impulse betting and other harmful behaviors.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that many people simply aren’t very good at gambling. They may be making uninformed bets or playing games they don’t understand well. As a result, they’re constantly losing money without even realizing it.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, the fact remains that gamblers are losing more money than ever before. This poses a serious threat not just to the casino industry, but also to the millions of people who rely on it for their livelihoods.</p>
<h1 id="Where-does-all-the-money-lost-on-gaming-go"><a href="#Where-does-all-the-money-lost-on-gaming-go" class="headerlink" title="Where does all the money lost on gaming go?"></a>Where does all the money lost on gaming go?</h1><p>Though it is hard to estimate how much money is lost on gaming every year, it is a safe assumption that the number is staggering. Many people enjoy spending their time and money on games, but where does all of that money go?</p>
<p>The simple answer is that it goes to the developers, publishers, and retailers of games. The people who create and sell games make a lot of money from gamers’ spending, and there is no indication that this trend will change any time soon.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that video games have become increasingly complex and expensive to make. In order to create a game that can compete with the top titles on the market, developers need to invest a lot of money into research and development. This often means that the cost of games continues to increase, which in turn results in players having to spend more money in order to keep up.</p>
<p>Another reason why so much money ends up going to publishers and developers is the high cost of marketing. Games nowadays often require extensive advertising campaigns in order to be successful, and this can be very costly. Many big-budget games will end up losing money hand over fist if they don’t recoup their advertising expenses.</p>
<p>So where does all of the money lost on gaming go? In most cases, it simply ends up in the pockets of game publishers and developers. While this may not be ideal for gamers, it seems unlikely that things will change anytime soon. With ever-rising development costs and marketing expenses, it’s clear why so much money ends up being lost on gaming each year.</p>
<h1 id="Gaming-losses-expected-to-top-130-billion-this-year"><a href="#Gaming-losses-expected-to-top-130-billion-this-year" class="headerlink" title="Gaming losses expected to top $130 billion this year"></a>Gaming losses expected to top $130 billion this year</h1><p>The gambling industry is on pace to lose more than $130 billion this year, according to a report from the McKinsey Global Institute. That’s up from $107 billion in 2017. The growth is being driven by an increase in sports betting and casino gambling, especially in Asia and Africa.</p>
<p>Revenue from gaming is expected to exceed $700 billion by 2023, the report said. Much of that growth will come from developing countries, where casinos are being built at a rapid pace. In China, for example, the number of casinos is expected to more than double by 2025.</p>
<p>The global gaming industry has been hampered by regulatory hurdles and negative public sentiment in recent years. But that is starting to change as governments come to see the potential benefits of gambling tourism and tax revenue.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a major concern, but policymakers are starting to realize that it can be managed with effective regulation. Some countries are even moving toward online gambling, which offers more safeguards against addiction.</p>
<p>Overall, the global gaming industry is growing rapidly and presents major opportunities for investors and policymakers alike.</p>
<h1 id="What-will-happen-to-the-gaming-industry-with-all-these-losses"><a href="#What-will-happen-to-the-gaming-industry-with-all-these-losses" class="headerlink" title="What will happen to the gaming industry with all these losses?"></a>What will happen to the gaming industry with all these losses?</h1><p>The gaming industry has been taking a beating lately with several high-profile companies posting heavy losses. What will this mean for the future of gaming?</p>
<p>First, let’s take a look at what’s been happening. Just in the past few weeks, we’ve seen:</p>
<p>*EA reporting a loss of $ Turbine shutting down *Disney shutting down *Telltale Games firing 90% of their staff</p>
<p>These are just a few examples – there have been many other closures and layoffs in the gaming industry over the past year or so.</p>
<p>So, what’s causing all these losses? There are a number of factors at work here. One is simply that the gaming market is becoming saturated – there are more games than ever before, and it’s becoming harder and harder to stand out. Additionally, consoles are becoming less popular as people move towards mobile gaming.</p>
<p>But perhaps the biggest issue is that most gamers are no longer buying games outright. Instead, they’re opting for free-to-play games or playing games that they’ve already paid for. This means that developers and publishers are getting less revenue per player, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to make money from games.</p>
<p>What does all this mean for the future of gaming? It’s hard to say for sure, but it seems likely that we’ll see more closures and layoffs in the coming years. Console gaming may become less popular, while mobile gaming will continue to grow. We may also see a shift towards more free-to-play models, as these tend to be more profitable for developers.</p>

        <h1 id="Garden-Casino-is-a-risky-investment"><a href="#Garden-Casino-is-a-risky-investment" class="headerlink" title="Garden Casino is a risky investment!"></a>Garden Casino is a risky investment!</h1><p>There has been a lot of buzz lately about a new casino that is going to be built in the heart of the city. It is supposed to be a magnificent structure, with beautiful gardens and fountains surrounding it. There are already posters all over town advertising it. The Garden Casino is sure to be a tourist attraction, and people are eager to find out more about it.</p>
<p>So what’s the problem?</p>
<p>The problem is that this casino is a risky investment! It’s not just the gambling that’s risky, but also the construction project itself. There are no guarantees that the casino will be successful, and it could end up costing investors a lot of money.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why this casino might not be as successful as people hope. First of all, casinos have been having problems lately due to online gambling. People can now gamble from home on their computers, and they don’t need to go to a casino anymore. This has been causing casinos to lose business and revenue.</p>
<p>Another reason why the Garden Casino might not do well is because of its location. It’s going to be built in a tourist area, but there are already plenty of other casinos there. These other casinos may offer better deals and services, which could cause people to choose them instead of the Garden Casino.</p>
<p>There are also concerns about the construction project itself. It’s estimated that it will cost around $400 million to build, and there’s no guarantee that it will be completed on time or within budget. If something goes wrong with the construction project, investors could lose a lot of money.</p>
<p>So should you invest in the Garden Casino?</p>
<p>It depends on your risk tolerance level! If you’re comfortable with taking risks, then you might want to invest in this casino. But if you’re not comfortable with risking your money, then you should probably stay away from it. There’s no guarantee that this casino will be successful, so it’s important to understand the risks before investing your money</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Crime: There is a risk that the casino will increase crime rates in the area. This could include robbery, assault, fraud, and other crimes.</p>

<li><p>Traffic congestion: The casino could cause traffic congestion in the area, as people come to gamble and visit the restaurants and shops. This could also lead to pollution and air quality problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Negative impact on businesses: The casino could have a negative impact on businesses in the area, as people would rather gamble than spend their money at local businesses. This could lead to job losses and reduced profits for local businesses.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jobs: The casino could create thousands of jobs in the area, which would be a boon for the local economy. This would include jobs in the casino itself as well as jobs in restaurants, hotels, and other businesses that would be supported by the casino.</li>

<p>At Garden Casino, we want our customers to be aware of the risks before they start playing. Here are some of the most common risks associated with gambling:</p>
<ol>

</li>
<li><p>Social isolation: Gambling can often lead to social isolation as people begin to spend more and more time at the casino or online gambling sites. This can have a negative impact on personal relationships and work life.</p>

This can include anything from a robbery or fire to an employee theft or computer glitch.</p>
<p>Another type of risk is financial risk. This is the risk that the casino’s financial position will worsen, leading to a decrease in value for shareholders or even bankruptcy. Financial risks can stem from things like an increase in overhead costs, a change in consumer behavior, or too much debt.</p>
<p>A third type of risk is reputational risk. This is the risk that the casino will become known for something negative, such as being associated with organized crime or money laundering. Such a reputation could lead to fewer customers and&#x2F;or investors, and could even result in legal penalties.</p>

Each tile has a different symbol on it, and you must match symbols up in order to remove them from the board. </p>

The game is a complex mix of skill, strategy and luck, and can be enjoyed by players of all ages.</p>
<p>If you’re new to Mahjong, or if you’re looking for some tips on how to improve your gameplay, read on for the essential guide to playing Mahjong.</p>
<h1 id="The-Mahjong-Board"><a href="#The-Mahjong-Board" class="headerlink" title="The Mahjong Board"></a>The Mahjong Board</h1><p>The Mahjong board is made up of a grid of tiles, with each tile representing a different character or object. The aim of the game is to remove all of the tiles from the board by matching them together.</p>
<p>There are several different types of Mahjong board, but the most common type is a 4x4 board with 16 tiles in total. Other boards may have different numbers of tiles and different shapes, so it’s important to be familiar with the layout of your board before starting the game.</p>
<h1 id="The-Tiles"><a href="#The-Tiles" class="headerlink" title="The Tiles"></a>The Tiles</h1><p>There are three main types of Mahjong tiles: Honour Tiles, Character Tiles and Bonus Tiles. Honour Tiles are red and include the Chinese symbol for East (東), West (西), South (南) and North (北). Character Tiles are green and represent various objects such as flowers, animals and plants. There are also four Bonus Tiles which are typically depicted as gold coins.</p>
<p>Bonus Tiles do not belong to any particular set, and can be matched with any other tile. However, they cannot be used to form sequences or triplets like other tiles can.</p>
<h1 id="The-Hand"><a href="#The-Hand" class="headerlink" title="The Hand"></a>The Hand</h1><p>A Mahjong hand consists of 14 tiles arranged in four groups of three tiles known as “suits”. There are three suits in Mahjong - dots (圓), bamboos (紙) and characters (人). Each suit contains two Honour Tiles and one Character Tile. The suits should be arranged in descending order according to their value, with 1 being the highest and 9 being the lowest. So your hand might look something like this:</p>
<p>The six dots represent the number 6 suit, while the two bamboos represent the number 2 suit. As there is no 3 suit in Mahjong, there is no 3rd Honour Tile in this hand. Finally, the character “人” represents the number 4 suit.</p>

Once you have two pairs, you can declare mahjong and collect points based on the value of the tiles your opponents are left with.</p>
<p>There are four different suits in Mahjong: circles, bamboo, characters, and seasons. The ranking of the tiles goes from one (1) to nine (9).

If passed, the bill could cost the city millions in lost revenue.</p>
<p>Texas is one of only a handful of states that doesn’t have specific laws regulating gambling. This has led to a patchwork of rules and regulations that vary from city to city. In Galveston, gambling is currently legal in casinos, race tracks, and bingo parlors.</p>
<p>The proposed ban on gambling would apply to all forms of gambling, including casino games, lottery tickets, and sports betting. It would also prohibit businesses from promoting or advertising gambling activities.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that gambling can lead to addiction and crime, and that it’s not appropriate for a family-friendly resort town like Galveston. They say the ban would protect residents and visitors from the negative effects of gambling.</p>
<p>Opponents of the ban argue that it would be a blow to the local economy, and that it’s not clear how it would be enforced. They also point out that Galveston already has laws prohibiting disorderly conduct and public intoxication, which should be enough to address any potential problems associated with gambling.</p>
<p>If passed, the ban on gambling would go into effect on January 1st, 2020.</p>
<h1 id="Proposed-Bill-to-Ban-Gambling-in-Galveston-met-with-Mixed-Reactions"><a href="#Proposed-Bill-to-Ban-Gambling-in-Galveston-met-with-Mixed-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="Proposed Bill to Ban Gambling in Galveston met with Mixed Reactions"></a>Proposed Bill to Ban Gambling in Galveston met with Mixed Reactions</h1><p>On Tuesday, the proposed bill to ban gambling in Galveston was met with mixed reactions from the people of the city. The proposed bill, which was announced by Mayor Jim Yarbrough, would make it illegal for any type of gambling activity to take place within city limits.</p>
<p>While some residents voiced their support for the bill, others argued that it would do more harm than good. One resident even went as far as to say that the ban would only push gambling activity underground and make it more difficult to track and regulate.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no official word on when or if the bill will be voted on by the city council. In the meantime, both supporters and opponents of the proposed ban will continue to make their voices heard.</p>
<h1 id="More-than-Half-of-Galveston-Supports-Banning-Gambling"><a href="#More-than-Half-of-Galveston-Supports-Banning-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="More than Half of Galveston Supports Banning Gambling"></a>More than Half of Galveston Supports Banning Gambling</h1><p>According to a recent poll, more than half of Galveston County residents support banning gambling in the island city. The poll, which was commissioned by the anti-gambling group Citizens Against Gambling in Galveston (CAGG), found that 55 percent of those surveyed supported a ban on all forms of gambling in the city.</p>
<p>“This poll confirms what we’ve been hearing from our members for years,” said CAGG spokesperson Stephanie Neely. “Galveston residents don’t want gambling in their city and they are tired of its negative effects.”</p>
<p>The poll also found that 73 percent of respondents believe that gambling has had a negative impact on Galveston, while 71 percent said they believe it contributes to crime. In addition, more than two-thirds (68 percent) said they think gambling is harmful to the local economy.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized gambling have argued that it can be a source of revenue for the city, but the poll shows that most Galveston residents don’t believe that is the case. Only 29 percent of respondents said they thought gambling generated significant revenue for Galveston, while 58 percent said it generated little or no revenue.</p>
<p>Neely praised the results of the poll and thanked everyone who participated. “We are grateful to the citizens of Galveston for standing with us against gambling,” she said. “We will continue working to make sure that Galveston remains a safe and healthy community free from this harmful industry.”</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-in-Galveston-Could-be-Outlawed-as-Early-as-Next-Week"><a href="#Gambling-in-Galveston-Could-be-Outlawed-as-Early-as-Next-Week" class="headerlink" title="Gambling in Galveston Could be Outlawed as Early as Next Week"></a>Gambling in Galveston Could be Outlawed as Early as Next Week</h1><p>Gambling in Galveston could be outlawed as early as next week, if the city council votes in favor of the proposed ordinance.</p>
<p>The ordinance, which was first proposed by Mayor Jim Yarbrough, would prohibit all forms of gambling within the city limits, including charitable bingo and casino nights.</p>
<p>Yarbrough said that he proposed the ordinance after hearing complaints from residents about the negative effects of gambling.</p>
<p>“I’ve had a number of people come to me and say that they don’t like it when their neighbor is trying to beat them at bingo or when they have to listen to people screaming and carrying on at the casino night,” Yarbrough said.</p>
<p>Supporters of the ordinance argue that it would help reduce crime and promote responsible gambling behavior. However, opponents argue that it would lead to job losses and hurt the local economy.</p>
<p>The vote on the ordinance is scheduled for next Wednesday.</p>
<h1 id="Texas-Could-Lose-Millions-If-Gambling-is-Banned-in-Galveston"><a href="#Texas-Could-Lose-Millions-If-Gambling-is-Banned-in-Galveston" class="headerlink" title="Texas Could Lose Millions If Gambling is Banned in Galveston"></a>Texas Could Lose Millions If Gambling is Banned in Galveston</h1><p>A recent study by the University of Houston’s Hobby School of Public Affairs has found that if Texas bans gambling in Galveston, the state could lose millions of dollars in revenue.</p>
<p>The study, which was funded by the Casino Association of Texas, estimates that the state would lose $410 million in revenue if casino gambling is banned in Galveston. This would include revenue from taxes and jobs at the casinos.</p>
<p>Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has called for a ban on casino gambling in Galveston, saying that it is a “threat to families and children.” He has also cited concerns about crime and addiction as reasons for wanting to ban casino gambling in the city.</p>
<p>However, opponents of the ban say that it would cost the state jobs and revenue. They also argue that there is no evidence that casino gambling is harmful to families or communities.</p>
<p>The debate over casino gambling in Galveston is likely to continue, but one thing is clear: If Texas bans gambling in Galveston, it will lose millions of dollars in revenue.</p>

        <h1 id="Thailand-Raises-Minimum-Gambling-Age-to-21"><a href="#Thailand-Raises-Minimum-Gambling-Age-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Thailand Raises Minimum Gambling Age to 21"></a>Thailand Raises Minimum Gambling Age to 21</h1><p>Thailand is the latest country to raise the minimum gambling age amid concerns over addiction and social ills. The new measure, which took effect on Jan. 1, raises the minimum age from 18 to 21.</p>
<p>“The government wants to protect people, especially the young, from being harmed by gambling,” said a government spokesman.</p>
<p>Thailand is not the only country to take this step; both Japan and South Korea have also raised their minimum gambling ages in recent years. In Japan, the minimum age was raised from 18 to 20 in 2017, while in South Korea it was increased from 19 to 21 in 2012.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for raising the minimum gambling age. One is that young people are more vulnerable to developing addictions than adults. Another reason is that gambling can have negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole. Gambling can lead to financial problems, family conflict, and even crime.</p>
<p>Some people argue that raising the minimum age does not go far enough and that all gambling should be banned for people of all ages. However, others argue that adults should be allowed to make their own decisions about whether or not to gamble. They say that if someone is old enough to vote or serve in the military, they should be old enough to gamble legally.</p>
<p>What do you think? Should the minimum gambling age be raised? Is it right for adults to be able to gamble freely, or should there be restrictions in place? Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below!</p>
<h1 id="Thailand-Government-Announces-Increase-in-Gambling-Age"><a href="#Thailand-Government-Announces-Increase-in-Gambling-Age" class="headerlink" title="Thailand Government Announces Increase in Gambling Age"></a>Thailand Government Announces Increase in Gambling Age</h1><p>The Thai government has announced that it will increase the minimum gambling age from 18 to 21 as part of a new national strategy to combat problem gambling. The move, which was first proposed by the Thai National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO) in November last year, is set to come into effect on 1st February 2019.</p>
<p>Thailand is one of only a handful of countries where the minimum legal gambling age is 18. In neighbouring Malaysia, the age limit is 21, while in Singapore it is 23. The United States has a minimum gambling age of 21, while in Australia it is 18.</p>
<p>In announcing the change, Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam said that raising the minimum age would help protect young people from becoming addicted to gambling. “We have to think about the future and how we can protect our children from negative effects such as addictive behaviour and indebtedness,” he said.</p>
<p>According to a study by Mahidol University released last year, around 10% of Thais aged 15-19 are problem gamblers, with the figure rising to 16% among those in their early 20s. The study also showed that problem gamblers are more likely to experience mental health problems such as depression and anxiety, as well as financial difficulties.</p>
<p>In response to criticism that the new measure will push problem gamblers underground and make it more difficult for them to access help, Mr Krea-ngam said that the government would be stepping up its efforts to provide prevention and treatment services. “We are not just increasing the age limit but also preparing measures to deal with addiction problems including expanding centres nationwide and increasing manpower at these centres by three times,” he said.</p>
<p>Critics have also raised concerns that the change will have a negative impact on Thailand’s casino industry, which currently employs around 300,000 people. However, Mr Krea-ngam insisted that this would not be the case. “The government does not intent to close down casinos but wants them to be run responsibly under stricter rules,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Thailand-Extends-Gambling-Age-to-Combat-Addiction"><a href="#Thailand-Extends-Gambling-Age-to-Combat-Addiction" class="headerlink" title="Thailand Extends Gambling Age to Combat Addiction"></a>Thailand Extends Gambling Age to Combat Addiction</h1><p>Thailand has announced that it is extending the gambling age from 18 to 20 in an attempt to address a growing gambling addiction problem. The news was confirmed by Deputy Prime Minister Wissanu Krea-ngam, who said that the change will come into effect later this year.</p>
<p>The extended gambling age is just one of a number of new measures being put in place by the Thai government in order to combat gambling addiction. The government is also investing in increasing public awareness of the dangers of gambling, and plans to provide more support services for those with addiction problems.</p>
<p>Gambling is a popular pastime in Thailand, and there are numerous legal and illegal casinos throughout the country. Gambling addiction is a serious problem, however, with an estimated 2 million Thais addicted to gambling. In addition to causing financial problems for those affected, gambling addiction can also lead to health problems and social isolation.</p>
<p>The government’s new measures are aimed at addressing these issues. In addition to the extended gambling age, officials plans to shut down unlicensed casinos and increase restrictions on advertising for casinos. They are also considering introducing a cap on the amount that people can bet each day.</p>
<p>It is hoped that these measures will help reduce Thailand’s gambling addiction rates and improve the lives of those affected by it.</p>
<h1 id="Minimum-Gambling-Age-in-Thailand-Increased-to-21"><a href="#Minimum-Gambling-Age-in-Thailand-Increased-to-21" class="headerlink" title="Minimum Gambling Age in Thailand Increased to 21"></a>Minimum Gambling Age in Thailand Increased to 21</h1><p>On 1st December 2017, the Thai government announced that the minimum gambling age is being increased from 18 to 21. This is part of a crackdown on illegal gambling in the country.</p>
<p>The new gambling law came into effect on 1st January 2018. It covers all forms of gambling, including online gambling and sports betting. The minimum age for these activities has been increased from 18 to 21.</p>
<p> violators of the new law could face a jail sentence of up to five years or a fine of up to 100,000 Baht (approximately US$3,000).</p>
<p>The government has said that the aim of the new law is to protect young people from the harms associated with gambling. These include addiction, financial problems, and social problems.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have criticised the government for increasing the minimum age, saying that it will force young people to gamble illegally. However, the government has defended the move, saying that it is necessary to protect young people from harm.</p>
<h1 id="Thailand-Increases-Gambling-Age-to-Combat-Problem-Gambling"><a href="#Thailand-Increases-Gambling-Age-to-Combat-Problem-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Thailand Increases Gambling Age to Combat Problem Gambling"></a>Thailand Increases Gambling Age to Combat Problem Gambling</h1><p>In a move to combat the increasing problem of gambling addiction in Thailand, the government has voted to raise the minimum age for gambling from 18 to 21. The new law will go into effect on July 1st, 2018.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem in Thailand, with an estimated 2 million people addicted to gambling. This accounts for about 10 percent of the population. In addition to the health and social problems caused by gambling addiction, it also costs the Thai economy an estimated $6.4 billion per year.</p>
<p>The government has been trying to address the problem of gambling addiction for many years, but with limited success. The new law raising the minimum age for gambling is hoped to be more effective in combating the problem.</p>
<p>Under the new law, only people over 21 will be able to gamble in casinos, bet on horse racing, or play lottery games. People under 21 will still be able to gamble in online casinos and betting parlors, but these establishments will have to obtain a license from the government in order to operate.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for individuals and families. The new law raising the minimum age for gambling is a step in the right direction in combating this problem in Thailand.</p>

The disorder often carries a social stigma, causing those who struggle with it to feel ashamed and reluctant to seek help. But problem gambling is an addiction like any other, and it deserves to be treated as such.</p>
<p>An estimated 2 percent of the world’s population is affected by problem gambling. This amounts to nearly 470 million people, making it one of the most common addictions in the world. And yet, too often it is viewed as a harmless pastime.</p>
<p>The reality is quite different. Gambling can have a devastating impact on both the gambler’s life and their loved ones. It can lead to financial ruin, job loss, relationship problems, and even suicide.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why people develop a gambling addiction. Some may be drawn to the thrill of the game or the potential for big winnings. Others may use gambling as a way to cope with stress or emotional problems. Whatever the reason, problem gambling is a serious disorder that requires treatment.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. There are many rehab centres that specialize in treating this type of addiction. Don’t hesitate to seek help if you need it. You don’t have to fight this battle alone.</p>

Problem gambling is the most serious type of gambling addiction and occurs when someone loses the ability to control their betting habits.</p>
<p>Problem gambling can have a serious impact on both the individual and their loved ones. The most common symptoms of problem gambling include losing large sums of money, chasing losses, lying about gambling, borrowing money from friends or family to gamble with, selling possessions to finance gambling and neglecting bills or chores in order to gamble.</p>
<p>Those affected by problem gambling are also at risk of depression, anxiety and suicide. In extreme cases, problem gamblers may resort to criminal activity in order to fund their addiction.</p>
<p>The cost of problem gambling to society is estimated to be over $5 billion annually in the United States alone. This figure includes costs related to crime, healthcare, bankruptcy and lost productivity. It is believed that the true cost of problem gambling is much higher as many problems caused by gambling are not reported.</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can be treated through a combination of therapies including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), motivational interviewing and medication if necessary. For those affected by problem gambling, treatment is essential in order to protect themselves and their loved ones from the negative consequences of this disorder.</p>

It can ruin lives, marriages, and families. It is also potentially very costly, both financially and emotionally.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why people become addicted to gambling. Some may be trying to escape from their problems, while others may find the thrill of gambling addicting. Whatever the reason, it is important to understand the risks associated with gambling addiction before you decide to gamble.</p>
<p>According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, one in six people in the United States have a problem with gambling. This means that millions of people are at risk for developing an addiction to gambling.</p>
<p>The most common sign of a gambling addiction is when someone cannot control their gambling behavior. They may continue to gamble even after losing money or experience negative consequences as a result of their gambling.</p>
<p>People with a gambling addiction may also exhibit other signs and symptoms such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>feeling anxious or restless when they cannot gamble</li>
<li>lying about their gambling habits</li>
<li>being unable to resist the urge to gamble</li>
<li>feeling helpless and hopeless about their situation</li>
<li>withdrawing from friends and family members</li>

<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to seek help right away. There are many resources available for people who want to get help, including counseling, support groups, and treatment programs.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-addiction-rates-increase-as-pala-casino-expands"><a href="#Gambling-addiction-rates-increase-as-pala-casino-expands" class="headerlink" title="Gambling addiction rates increase as pala casino expands"></a>Gambling addiction rates increase as pala casino expands</h1><p>Gambling addiction rates are on the rise across the United States, and experts say the expansion of casinos, including Pennsylvania’s new pala casino, is to blame.</p>
<p>A report released in February by the Gaming Commission found that one in five problem gamblers in Massachusetts resides in the Greater Boston area, home to pala casino and two other resorts. In 2013, the last year for which data was available, there were 5,500 problem gamblers in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Nationwide, gambling addiction is becoming an increasingly big problem. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that between 6 and 8 million Americans are addicted to gambling.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-causing-this-increase-in-gambling-addiction-rates"><a href="#What-is-causing-this-increase-in-gambling-addiction-rates" class="headerlink" title="What is causing this increase in gambling addiction rates?"></a>What is causing this increase in gambling addiction rates?</h1><p>So what is causing this increase in gambling addiction rates? There are a number of factors at play.</p>
<p>For one, casinos are becoming more prevalent. In addition to traditional casinos, there are now Indian casinos, online casinos, and state-run lotteries. With so many options available, it’s easier than ever for people to develop a gambling habit.</p>
<p>Another factor is that gambling is increasingly being viewed as a socially acceptable form of entertainment. With so much advertising geared towards convincing people that gambling is a fun activity, it’s no wonder so many people are succumbing to its lure.</p>
<p>And finally, many people view gambling as a way to make easy money. They think that if they just put a little money on red at the roulette table or bet on their favorite team, they’ll be sure to come out ahead. But as anyone who has ever gambled knows, this is not always the case. In fact, most people who gamble lose money in the long run.</p>

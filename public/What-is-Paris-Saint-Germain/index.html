        <h1 id="What-is-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#What-is-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="What is Paris Saint-Germain?"></a>What is Paris Saint-Germain?</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain (French pronunciation: ​[paʁi sɛ̃ ʒɛʁmɛ̃]), commonly known as Paris SG, Paris St-Germain or simply PSG, is a French professional football club based in the city of Paris. The club was formed in 1970 by the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain. PSG are the most successful club in French football history, having won 31 titles, including a record six Ligue 1 championships.</p>
<p>PSG have also reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League on four occasions, reaching the final twice. The club has a huge following both domestically and internationally with over 34 million fans across social media platforms.</p>
<p>The Parc des Princes is the team’s home stadium and one of the largest stadiums in Europe, with a capacity of 48,749. PSG have several sister clubs around the world such as New York City FC in the United States, Al-Ahli Saudi FC in Saudi Arabia and São Paulo FC in Brazil.</p>
<h1 id="Origins"><a href="#Origins" class="headerlink" title="Origins"></a>Origins</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain were formed on 12 August 1970 following the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain. The combined club took the name of Paris Saint-Germain and adopted purple and white as their colours.[5] PSG played their first match on 27 August 1970 against Racing Club de France resulting in a 3–0 victory for PSG.[6]</p>
<p>In 1972, Pierre Gueguen became president of PSG and subsequently led the club to its first Coupe de France title in 1976. However, PSG were relegated from Division 1 two years later. Following Gueguen’s departure, Francis Borelli was appointed president and led the club back to Division 1 in 1983 before winning back-to-back Coupe de France titles in 1984 and 1985. In 1986, coached by Luis Fernandez, PSG reached their first European Cup semi-final where they narrowly lost out to Bayern Munich on away goals.</p>
<h1 id="Where-is-Paris-Saint-Germain-located"><a href="#Where-is-Paris-Saint-Germain-located" class="headerlink" title="Where is Paris Saint-Germain located?"></a>Where is Paris Saint-Germain located?</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain F.C. is a professional association football club based in Paris, France. The club was formed in 1970 by the merger of two Paris-based clubs, Stade Saint-Germain and Paris FC. The holy trinity of strikers – Pauleta, Valdo and Rai helped PSG clinch their first ever Ligue 1 title in 1994&#x2F;1995 season which was also a historical season as it witnessed the retirement of one the greatest player to have graced the game, Michel Platini.</p>
<p>Sitting at the heart of France’s capital city, Paris Saint-Germain can be found at Parc des Princes Stadium – just south of the River Seine on Avenues Jean Baptiste Pointe Du Lac and Georges Pompidou respectively.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-main-rivals-of-PSG"><a href="#Who-are-the-main-rivals-of-PSG" class="headerlink" title="Who are the main rivals of PSG?"></a>Who are the main rivals of PSG?</h1><p>Since its inception, PSG has had several notable rivalries with fellow Ligue 1 sides Olympique de Marseille and AS Monaco; while also developing a more recent rivalry with Liga MX’s Club América (Mexico City).</p>
<p>However, it is their games against Olympique Lyonnais that are considered as the biggest fixtures for both PSG and their fans. The two teams have met in 42 editions of French domestic cup competitions (with Lyon winning 24 times to PSG’s 18), making it the most contested trophy rivalry between any two French football clubs.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-owners-of-Paris-Saint-Germain"><a href="#Who-are-the-owners-of-Paris-Saint-Germain" class="headerlink" title="Who are the owners of Paris Saint-Germain?"></a>Who are the owners of Paris Saint-Germain?</h1><p>Paris Saint-Germain is a professional association football club based in Paris, France. The club was formed on 12 August 1970 by the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain. The current owners are Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), a state-owned company of the Qatar government.</p>
<p>The takeover by QSI was announced on 25 May 2011. The deal, worth around €100 million, netting the club an immediate cash injection. Since then, the club has gone from strength to strength, both on and off the pitch. The huge investment from QSI has seen PSG become one of the biggest clubs in world football and they now compete regularly in the UEFA Champions League.</p>
<p>Qatar Sports Investments is a diversified sports company owned by the Qatar government. It is responsible for developing sport in Qatar and it has a wide range of interests, including owning Paris Saint-Germain F.C., AS Monaco FC and Al Jazeera Sport.</p>

<h1 id="How-much-money-do-they-spend-on-players’-wages"><a href="#How-much-money-do-they-spend-on-players’-wages" class="headerlink" title="How much money do they spend on players’ wages?"></a>How much money do they spend on players’ wages?</h1><p>The total amount of money being spent on players’ wages around the world is increasing each year. In 2015, it was estimated that clubs in Europe’s top five leagues spent a combined $5.3 billion on player salaries. That number is only going to continue to grow, as teams are becoming more and more willing to spend big money on the best talent around.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to measure how much money is being spent on players’ wages. One popular method is to look at the average salary of all players in a given league. Another way is to look at the amount of money being spent on the highest-paid players in a league. Regardless of which method is used, it is clear that spending on player salaries is rapidly increasing around the world.</p>
<p>In England’s Premier League, for example, the average salary of all players in the league was over $4 million in 2017. The top 10 earners in the Premier League all make over $10 million per year, and the two highest-paid players in the league - Paul Pogba and Neymar - both earn over $30 million per year.</p>
<p>In Spain’s La Liga, meanwhile, the average salary of all players was just under $3 million in 2017. The top 10 earners in La Liga make an average of just over $13 million per year, with Lionel Messi earning by far the most at over $37 million per year.</p>
<p>Italy’s Serie A averaged out to just under $2.5 million per player in 2017, while France’s Ligue 1 averaged just over $2 million per player. In Germany’s Bundesliga, meanwhile, the average salary was just under $2 million per player in 2017. The top 10 earners in the Bundesliga make an average of just over $9 million per year, with Robert Lewandowski earning by far the most at over $17 million per year.</p>
<p>So what is causing this rapid increase in spending on player salaries? There are a few factors at play here. First, teams are getting bigger and richer thanks to new TV deals and other sources of revenue growth. Additionally, there has been a global increase in demand for top talent as soccer (or football) continues its ascent as one of the world’s most popular sports. Lastly, technology has made it easier than ever for teams to scout and sign new players from around the world.</p>
<p>All of these factors have resulted in teams spending more and more money on acquiring and retaining talent. As this trend continues, we can expect to see even higher wages being paid to players around the world.</p>

<p>One popular strategy is known as “positive progression.” Under this strategy, you increase your bet size after each win and decrease it after each loss. This helps you to build your bankroll gradually while limiting your overall losses if you do happen to lose a few wagers in a row. However, this strategy also requires a high degree of discipline as you need to be able to walk away from the table when you are losing money instead of doubling down in an attemptto win it back.</p>
<p>Another popular strategy is known as “martingale.” Under this strategy,you double your bet size after each loss in an attemptto win back your losses plus one unit profit. While this strategy can be profitable over time, it can also leadto large losses if you encounter a series of consecutive losses. It’s important to note that this strategy should only be used with small bets, as doubling up on larger bets can leadto bankruptcy quickly.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stay disciplined while playing!</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s easy to get carried away when playing at an online casino but it’s important to stay disciplined at all times. Make sure that you only gamble with money that you can afford to lose and never gamble with money earmarked for bills or other essential expenses. Furthermore, set yourself limits on how much money you are willing tobet each day or week and stick to them religiously! This will help preventyou from going overboard while gambling and ending up in debtor worse!</p>

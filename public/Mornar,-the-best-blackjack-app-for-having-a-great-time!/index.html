<h1 id="How-to-make-the-most-of-your-Mornar-experience"><a href="#How-to-make-the-most-of-your-Mornar-experience" class="headerlink" title="How to make the most of your Mornar experience!"></a>How to make the most of your Mornar experience!</h1><p>When you arrive in Split, take a taxi to the ferry terminal and buy your tickets for the island of Mornar. The ride is only about 30 minutes and well worth it – the island is drop-dead gorgeous! Once you arrive, there are several ways to make the most of your experience.</p>
<p>First, head to the beach! The water is crystal clear and perfect for swimming. There are several restaurants and bars right on the beach, so you can enjoy a refreshing drink or bite while taking in the incredible views. If you’d rather explore the island, there are plenty of hiking trails to choose from. Be sure to visit the ruins of an old fortress – it’s a great spot for photos.</p>
<p>In the evening, be sure to check out one of the many bars or restaurants on the island. There’s something for everyone, so you’re sure to find something you love. And don’t forget to enjoy the incredible sunsets – they’re absolutely unforgettable!</p>
<p>Mornar is definitely a place not to be missed – I guarantee you won’t regret your decision to visit.</p>
<h1 id="Get-the-most-out-of-your-Mornar-play"><a href="#Get-the-most-out-of-your-Mornar-play" class="headerlink" title="Get the most out of your Mornar play!"></a>Get the most out of your Mornar play!</h1><p>This guide will show you how to get the most out of your Mornar play!</p>
<p>The first step is to identify the key themes of the work. In Mornar, these are: betrayal, duty, and revenge. With these themes in mind, you can begin to look for specific examples in the text that illustrate them.</p>
<p>Betrayal is a major theme in Mornar. One of the best examples of this is when Mornar’s brother, Kralj, betrays him by joining forces with their enemies. This betrayal costs Mornar dearly, as it leads to his imprisonment and eventual exile.</p>
<p>Another theme that is prevalent in Mornar is duty. This is seen most clearly when Mornar chooses to return to his home country and fight against his former brother Kralj. Even though it means facing certain death, Mornar persists because he feels it is his duty to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, revenge is a critical factor in the story of Mornar. After being betrayed and exiled by his own brother, Mornar spends many years planning his revenge. When the time finally comes, he executes his plan flawlessly and succeeds in taking down Kralj.</p>
<p>Once you have a good understanding of the key themes of the work, you can begin to look for specific quotes that support them. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>On betrayal: “My own brother… He has joined our enemies.” (Mornar)<br>“I am returning to my countrymen not as their friend but as their avenger.” (Mornar)  “All these years I have dreamed of this moment – of taking my revenge upon Kralj.” (Mornar)<br>“Revenge is a dish best served cold.” (Moral of the story)</p>
<p>On duty: “I am returning to my countrymen not as their friend but as their avenger.” (Mornar)  “It is my duty to do so.” (Mornar)</p>
